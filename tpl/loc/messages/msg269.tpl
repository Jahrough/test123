<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Ultimately, you are responsible for securing data
and the applications you access on the computer you use. The use of strong
passwords acts as a deterrent against password guessing. The security of each
individual user is closely related to the security of the whole system. Creating
effective passwords can provide additional means of protecting the information
on your computer.</FONT></DIV>

  someone.</FONT></LI>

  it via email.</FONT></LI></UL>
