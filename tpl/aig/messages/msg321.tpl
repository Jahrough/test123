    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Vehicle Location History, powered by license plate reader technology, is now available for use.  This new enhancement is a valuable tool for uncovering fraud, locating stolen vehicles, assisting with the investigation of garaging location, and personal/commercial use material misrepresentation within the claims handling process.

Vehicle locations can be obtained with a license plate or address search.  Full vehicle location details are available with the ability to download reports - mapped locations with GPS coordinates, date and time of image capture, license plate and vehicle images.
