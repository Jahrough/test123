<FONT color=#cc0033 face=Arial><STRONG>Access to Social Network Report Easier than Ever On Expanded Reports Toolbar</strong></font>
<FONT size=2 face=Arial><br><br>
On October 7, 2010, Accurint&reg; for Insurance will debut an expanded reports toolbar that delivers faster, simpler access to key reports within Person Search and Advanced Person Search functions.&nbsp; The toolbar will also feature a new icon for the recently released Social Network Report.
<br><br>
The Social Network Report searches over 35 social networking sites for a match against email addresses linked to a specific search subject.&nbsp; Matching page results return public-facing pages that provide relevant information about your search subject's physical location, specific date and event timing and other subject-provided data.&nbsp; This search delivers pertinent information to quickly get you closer to your search subject.&nbsp; The Social Network Report can be used as a stand-alone resource or in conjunction with other tools to add a layer of real time, subject-provided information to better facilitate locating and contacting a search subject.&nbsp; The Social Network Report creates an avenue of unique data to drive more efficiency and greater cost savings into the process of locating search subjects.
<br><br>
The Social Network Report is $1.00 per hit and access is as easy as one click.&nbsp; For a preview of the new icon and the expanded reports toolbar, see below:
