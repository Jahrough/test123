    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    The State of New York has restricted access to vehicle registration data.&nbsp; As a result of this restriction, Real-Time Vehicle Registrations search will no longer provide current coverage for New York; however, access to historical New York registrations is available under the Motor Vehicles search.&nbsp; Be sure to check coverage* information for a full listing of available states.
    <br><br>
    *Due to contractual and regulatory restrictions, some of the states listed may not be available to you.
