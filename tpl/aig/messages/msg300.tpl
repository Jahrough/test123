    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Pursuant to a law passed in December 2013 (Section 203 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013), access to information contained in the Social Security Administration's Death Master File (DMF) is now limited for a three year period beginning on the date of an individual's death.&nbsp; As of March 26, 2014, access is limited to authorized users and recipients who qualify for certification.
    <br><br>
    A certification process was issued by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) late Friday, March 21, 2014.&nbsp; LexisNexis has received NTIS certification and will continue to receive ongoing updates to the DMF.
    <br><br>
    NTIS's certification program for access to the DMF requires companies receiving DMF information to have a permissible purpose under the new law and have processes in place to protect the data provided to them.
    <br><br>
    The permissible purposes for receipt of the Limited Access DMF data are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Legitimate fraud prevention interest, and;
      <li>Legitimate business purpose pursuant to a law, governmental rule, regulation, or fiduciary duty
    </ul>
    Pursuant to our license agreement, our customers must also comply with NTIS requirements.&nbsp; We will notify LexisNexis customers of these requirements for access to the Limited Access DMF shortly, and we are working diligently to minimize disruption of service to our customers.
    <br><br>
    Please be aware that there will be an impact on the currency of the deceased data our customers receive until they complete the LexisNexis certification process.&nbsp; For customers that do not qualify, then the deceased-records data received will exclude any DMF data for individuals with a date of death after March 26, 2014.&nbsp; Those records will remain unavailable for a period of three years from the date of the individual's death, after which time they will be made available.
    <br><br>
    LexisNexis has 121 Million records in its deceased-records database.&nbsp; (Currently, the DMF has 86 million records.)&nbsp; LexisNexis records include the current DMF data, as well as state data, and other proprietary data sources.&nbsp; Thus, for those customers that do not meet the requirements specific to the NTIS program, LexisNexis will continue to provide value as a result of our industry-leading compilation of deceased-records information from alternative sources.
    <br><br>
    LexisNexis will continue to update you as additional information becomes available.
