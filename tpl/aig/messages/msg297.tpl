    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Now in effect, users with access to full Social Security Numbers (SSNs) may see them partially masked for individuals found within the search results, affecting the first five digits.&nbsp; A user with full access to SSNs will be able to view the last four digits on the initial search results.&nbsp; Users can now click on the <b>unlock SSN</b> icon to obtain the unmasked SSN.  This change is being implemented to reduce the exposure of regulated data.

    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Due to voice of the customer feedback, we've enhanced the display order for vehicle records within the Motor Vehicle Search and Motor Vehicle Report results.&nbsp; To make the records found within the search results and report more intuitive, the results are now sorted by registration date and/or title date from most recent to oldest.&nbsp; This will allow users to search for a registrant, owner or vehicle and return a chronological list that will aid in determining the most current to oldest record.
    <br><br>
