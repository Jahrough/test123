    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    We value your business relationship with LexisNexis&reg;, and we'd like to proactively notify you of a near term functionality change to Accurint&reg; for Insurance, scheduled for <b>Thursday, December 5th, 2013.</b>
    <br><br>
    A minor change is being made to how fully displayed Social Security Numbers (SSN) are seen by Accurint for Insurance users within search results pages.&nbsp; Beginning on the night of December 5th, users with access to full Social Security Numbers (SSNs) may begin to see them partially masked for individuals found within the search results, affecting the first five digits.&nbsp; A user with full access to SSNs will be able to view the last four digits on the initial search results.&nbsp; Users can now click on the <b>unlock SSN</b> icon to obtain the full unmasked SSN.&nbsp; This change is being implemented to reduce the exposure of regulated data.
