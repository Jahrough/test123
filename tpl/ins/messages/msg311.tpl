    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    LexisNexis&reg; has enhanced the <b>Police Records Search</b> to better serve you.&nbsp; These enhancements include:
    <br><br>
    <b>Interactive Reports</b>
    <br><br>
    Police reports will now feature enhanced interactive functionality.&nbsp; This means users will receive immediate display of a police report when it is found in our electronic repository.
    <br><br>
    Benefits of Accelerated Police Report Procurement
    <ul>
      <li>Approximately 5% of police reports will be "instantly available" to Accurint&reg; for Insurance users.*
      <li>Approximately 16% improved turnaround time by an average of 2 days. *
      <li>Accelerated access will be made available at no additional cost to all Accurint for Insurance users regardless of the delivery method chosen.
    </ul>
    What to expect
    <ul>
      <li>If the police report is available for immediate access, upon order submission, the report will display in a separate pop-up window.
      <li>If the police report is not available for immediate access upon order submission, the user will continue to receive the standard order confirmation and email notification once the report is ready to be viewed.
    </ul>
    Tips and Tricks
    <ul>
      <li>Customers ordering through the Accurint for Insurance website are advised to disable pop-up blockers.
      <li>Users operating with higher versions of Internet Explorer may need to enable compatibility mode.
    </ul>
    *Based on the volume of police reports obtained through electronic crash report collection sources.
    <br><br>
    <b>User Roles</b>
    <br><br>
    User roles have been added.&nbsp; System Administrators can now control user access levels through My Account > Manage Users.
    <br><br>
    <b>Image Format</b>
    <br><br>
    Reports are now available in PDF and TIFF format.
    <br><br>
    <b>Email Delivery</b>
    <br><br>
    Two new email delivery types can be used when reports are ready for delivery.&nbsp; A clickable link can be emailed to users, and once clicked, reports can be accessed quickly.&nbsp; An email can also be sent with the record attached.
    <br><br>
    <b>Accessing Report Manager</b>
    <br><br>
    Accurint users no longer need to enter a password before accessing the Report Manager.&nbsp; Users are now taken directly to the Report Manager when this My Account option is clicked.
