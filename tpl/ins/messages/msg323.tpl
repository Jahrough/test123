    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    We'd like to proactively make you aware of an upcoming release, scheduled for Thursday, June 18<sup>th</sup>, 2015.
    <br><br>
    An additional layer of security is being added to protect your use of regulated public records data, such as Social Security Numbers and TINs.&nbsp; The powerful new identification feature goes beyond your LexisNexis log in ID and password to recognize your access footprint, that is, your device (PC, laptop, tablet, etc.) plus your browser (e.g., Internet Explorer<sup>&reg;</sup> and location (IP address) choices before allowing access.
    <br><br>
    Your organization -- and everyone it serves -- stays safer.&nbsp; Best of all, this added security takes only a few minutes to initiate.
    <br><br>
    <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; If your LexisNexis account has IP restrictions already in place with LexisNexis, and you can only access LexisNexis products from within your organization's network, you will not be impacted by this security upgrade.
    <br><br>
    <b>You must register and protect your access</b>
    <br>
    Once this feature has been released, you will be prompted to register your access.
    <br><br>
    1.&nbsp; <b>Select a method to receive an activation code</b> (aka OTP or one-time passcode):
    <ul>
      <li>email
      <li>mobile device text
      <li>phone voice message
    </ul>
    Select Send OTP.
    <br><br>
    2.&nbsp; <b>Retrieve your activation code</b> via the method you select. The temporary code expires after one hour.
    3.&nbsp; <b>Enter the activation code</b> to complete the process.
    <br><br>
    Once you enter the activation code, that <b>combination</b> of device, browser and IP address will be <b>recognized for up to 90 days.</b>&nbsp; During that time, you can access regulated public records data using that combination without entering a code again.
    <br><br>
    <b>Change combinations? It's easy to update your recognition</b>
    <br>
    What if you need to work with a different device, browser or location? For example, you:
    <ul>
      <li>Work at home on a tablet
      <li>Get a new PC or laptop at the office
      <li>Decide to try a different browser, e.g., Google Chrome&trade; instead of Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Internet Explorer
      <li>Travel frequently, using your laptop and regular browser and a hotel location (IP address)
    </ul>
    Anytime a different device, browser or location is detected, the registration and activation process is triggered, and the registration screens display automatically.&nbsp; Request an activation code, then retrieve and enter it.&nbsp; The new combination will now be recognized as well for up to 90 days. Fast, easy and still secure.
    <br><br>
    <b>If you do not register your access</b>
    <br>
    If you attempt to access Accurint<sup>&reg;</sup> for Insurance without registering, then your access will be downgraded so that permissible use data for GLBA and DPPA will be suppressed.
    <br><br>
    <b>LexisNexis<sup>&reg;</sup> Accurint<sup>&reg;</sup> Administrator can trigger OTP without calling Customer Support</b>
    <br>
    Previously, the Administrator would need to call Customer Support to add a new IP address when a user wanted access from an unapproved IP.&nbsp; Now, the Administrator can simply trigger an OTP and forego calling Customer Support.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions about this enhancement, please contact LexisNexis Customer Support at <b>866.277.8407  or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com/" target="_blank"><u>Email Us</u></b></a>
