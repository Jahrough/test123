    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Provider Report Card is a new report in the Accurint Health Care suite to verify provider input data.
    <br><br>
    The Report requires a minimum of input Name, address and either NPI Number or SSN, but including additional information is encouraged as only input data can be verified.
    <br><br>
    The Provider Report Card can potentially verify the following input data for the provider:
    <ul>
      <li>State Board License (on up to 5 input licenses)
      <li>National Provider Identifier  (NPI) Number
      <li>Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Number
      <li>Address
      <li>CLIA Certificate Number
      <li>Primary Taxonomy
      <li>ABMS Specialty
    </ul>
    In addition, the Provider Report Card will display an indicator if the provider may be deceased or have sanctions exclusions.
    <br><br>
    The price for the Provider Report Card is $5.00 per report.  Price listed is exclusive of any applicable discounts or special price plans.  Please contact your account representative with questions regarding the pricing in connection with your specific price plan.
    <br><br>
