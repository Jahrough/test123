    If you forget your password for Accurint&reg; for Insurance, you will no longer have to contact LexisNexis&reg; Customer Support or your account's System Administrator and wait for someone to assist you with resetting your password.&nbsp; The Forgot Password functionality allows you to have a temporary Accurint for Insurance password emailed back to your email address inbox following an unsuccessful password entry during a login attempt.&nbsp; Just follow the Forgot Password on screen prompts to register your user ID for the Forgot Password function.
    <br><br>
