    LexisNexis<sup>&reg;</sup> introduces the National Motor Vehicle Accidents Search and Report on Accurint for Insurance.  This exciting new feature located under the People tab will help insurance carriers quickly gain insight into accidents.  Historical data is available for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  After entering an individual's name, business' name, or a Vehicle Identification Number along with the state where the accident occurred, you will be able to gain insight into the parties and vehicles involved in a given accident.  Some states additionally require an approximate date of loss.  You will also have the option to order the archived image of the actual police report for the majority of results.  This will give you the ability to compare report details to information in your file and potentially also discover previously undisclosed accidents.
    <br><br>
    The price for the National Motor Vehicle Accidents Search is $2.00 per search and $12.00 for each accident report image you purchase through the "Purchase Archived Accident Report" link.  Reports traditionally found in the Florida Accidents Report will still be available where applicable as part of the "Accident Report" link at no additional cost. Prices listed are exclusive of any applicable discounts or special price plans. Please contact your account representative with questions regarding the pricing in connection with your specific price plan.
    <br><br>
    The National Motor Vehicle Accidents Search and Report utilizes one of the nation's largest proprietary historical accident databases which when combined with proprietary LexIDSM matching technology provides another Accurint for Insurance search feature and report option beyond public records.  Coverage does not represent all accidents for a given coverage area.  You can find the new feature under the People tab.
    <br><br>
    We hope you enjoy this new search and report and as always, we appreciate you choosing LexisNexis<sup>&reg;</sup>.  If you have any questions regarding this new enhancement, please contact LexisNexis Customer Support at 866.277.8407 or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com/" target="_blank"><b><u>Email Us</u></b></a>.
