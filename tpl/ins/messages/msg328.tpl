    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    A new checkbox "Include Full Address History" has been added to Advanced Person Search to provide you greater control of historical address views -- even when your search criteria is narrow (i.e., when name plus state are entered as search terms). So, when this box is checked, full address history will be returned, not limited to the address, city and/ or state submitted in the search form.
    <br><br>
    Advanced Person Search allows you to search broadly for your subject using additional criteria -- such as a relative name or previous state of residence -- or even partial information to more accurately pinpoint where they may reside.
    <br><br>
    *Search Tips have also been updated in the application (below the search form).
