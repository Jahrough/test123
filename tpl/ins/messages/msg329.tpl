    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    LexisNexis&reg; Risk Solutions is pleased to announce that crash reports from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) are now part of our law enforcement database.  This means you can now expect a greatly improved turnaround time at a much lower agency fee.  The agency fee for LAPD crash reports processed from our law enforcement database is $10.00, and the turnaround time our customers are currently experiencing is approximately two (2) weeks.  Crash reports from LAPD are received systematically into our infrastructure once they are approved by the police department.  There is no additional action needed on your part.  By using your existing LexisNexis platform of Accurint&reg; for Insurance to order LAPD crash reports, you will automatically experience this much improved turnaround time.
    <br><br>
    We are excited to offer this new, improved workflow from LAPD.  If you have any questions, please contact LexisNexis Customer Support at <b>866.277.8407</b> or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com" target="_blank"><u><b>Email Us.</b></u></a>
