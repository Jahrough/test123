In addition to adding these fields to the Motor Vehicle Report, these two fields were added to the Comprehensive and Custom Comprehensive Reports when the "Include Real-Time Vehicle(s) Registration" report option is selected.

      <li>Title issue date - indicates when the title was issued
      <li>Name source - indicate whether the owner is a registered owner, titled owner or both
