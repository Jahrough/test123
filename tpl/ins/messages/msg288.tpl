    Carrier ID does not constitute a "consumer report" as that term is defined in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681 et seq. (FCRA).&nbsp; Accordingly, Carrier ID may not be used in whole or in part as a factor in determining eligibility for credit, insurance, employment or another permissible purpose under the FCRA.&nbsp; Due to the nature of the origin of public record information, the public records and commercially available data sources used in reports may contain errors.&nbsp; Source data is sometimes reported or entered inaccurately, processed poorly or incorrectly, and is generally not free from defect.&nbsp; This product or service aggregates and reports data, as provided by the public records and commercially available data sources, and is not the source of th e data, nor is it a comprehensive compilation of the data.&nbsp; Before relying on any data, it should be independently verified.
