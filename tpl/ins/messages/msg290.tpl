    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Link ID is the advanced data linking technology behind your LexisNexis information solutions.&nbsp; It connects the breadth and depth of LexisNexis data sources to bring you relevant, insightful information, so you can make timely and accurate decisions.
    <br><br>
    When you run a Person Search, an individual's unique Link ID number is returned in the results.&nbsp; When you search using only the Link ID number in a new Person Search, you will gain:
    <ul>
      <li>A more precise and current view of your subject.</li>
      <li>An extensive history.</li>
      <li>Fast, optimum results.</li>
    </ul>
    Link ID delivers unmatched speed, intelligence and information so you can identify, analyze and locate your desired subjects.

    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    LexisNexis&reg; is pleased to announce that we recently enhanced Accurint with a new user interface feature -- "hover-over" functionality.&nbsp; 'Hover-over' functionality has been added to the search tabs to provide you with a quick view of searches available in each category.&nbsp; The available searches in the 'hover-over' list will also be hyperlinked and clicking on a search link will load the corresponding search form.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions regarding these new enhancements, please contact your LexisNexis Account Representative or call Customer Support at 1-866-277-8407.
