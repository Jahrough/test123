<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>LexisNexis&reg; &#8211; partnered with WebRecordTM &#8211; is 
introducing an email address-based social networking site search. Clients supply 
the subject&#8217;s email address which is then provided to WebRecord. The Social 
Network Report will provide the end user a list of all matching social network 
public-facing pages (URLs) for the search subject in cases where a match to the 
sites&#8217; registered email address is found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 35 social networking 
sites are checked for a match against the email address(es) submitted for the 
search subject.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Clients may wish to use this report to get a better 
sense of where the subject is physically located and obtain other information 
(interests, subject-provided content) that would aid in making contact. Matching 
page results are typically limited to public-facing pages, but often enough 
useful additional information is provided in these pages that can get the user 
closer to the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>

search subject (anything from associates to interests/activities/location 
information to timing (date relocated, date last logged in, other 
subject-provided dates), this search yields additional leads and tips that can 
help product users track down their subjects.</FONT></DIV>
