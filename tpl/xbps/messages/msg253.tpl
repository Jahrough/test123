<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Our Offline Court Searches have been expanded to 
allow you to conduct Court Searches on businesses.&nbsp; When accessing the 
Court Search Wizard from the Main Menu you can now choose to either search on an 
individual or a business.&nbsp; Take the guesswork out of your research!&nbsp; 
Our Nationwide Court Search enables you to obtain civil and criminal histories 
without ever having to leave your office.&nbsp; Our easy-to-use Court Search 
Wizard will determine, through our extensive database, a possible address 
history for the subject of your search as well as identify the county, state and 
federal searches available.&nbsp; We dispatch trained Court researchers to over 
3,000 courthouses across the country to retrieve the most current information 
and deliver it electronically to your desktop.</FONT></DIV>
