    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Invaluable investigatory data exists on the internet about those who share information on themselves - blogs, photos, social networks, videos, etc.  In response to customer feedback, an enhanced social media search is now available.  Social Media Locator will provide instant access to a comprehensive social media and web profile view for subjects of interest.  Save time and money by avoiding tedious manual searching.  The powerful linking algorithms of Social Media Locator will allow you to search using a multitude of search input fields to quickly find publically available content on individuals, organizations and businesses.
    <br><br>
    If you have minimal information, Social Media Locator can be accessed as an add-on option to Person Search, Advanced Person Search, Email Search or Phones Plus.  Clicking on the Social Media Locator option, from any one of these searches, will carry over search result information to the Social Media Locator.  After information populates in Social Media Locator, additional search input criteria can be entered before running the search.

    <font color="#ed1c24" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3"><b>MORE Flexibility and Control with LexisNexis&reg; Advanced Person Search</b></font>
    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    A new checkbox "Include Full Address History" has been added to Advanced Person Search to provide you greater control of historical address views -- even when your search criteria is narrow (i.e., when name plus state are entered as search terms). So, when this box is checked, full address history will be returned, not limited to the address, city and/ or state submitted in the search form.
    <br><br>
    Advanced Person Search allows you to search broadly for your subject using additional criteria -- such as a relative name or previous state of residence -- or even partial information to more accurately pinpoint where they may reside.
    <br><br>
    *Search Tips have also been updated in the application (below the search form).
    <br><br>
