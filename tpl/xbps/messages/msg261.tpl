<font face="Arial" size="-1"
><br><br>
All Internet users should be aware of the online scam known as
"phishing" (pronounced "fishing"). Phishing involves the use of e-mail
messages that appear to come from your bank or another trusted business
such as Risk Investigations, but are actually from imposters.&nbsp; All your
Risk Investigations business web access should be done through our
secure Web site.&nbsp; <b>We will not send you an e-mail with links to our
site, nor will we provide you links to download software to your
computer.</b><br>
<br>
Always start login from: <b>https://riskinvestigations.lexisnexis.com</b>
and never enter your ID or Password information at any other URL or
site, or your security may be compromised. Never click or follow links
to Risk Investigations from email messages because if you do so you may
be taken to a site that looks like Risk Investigations but is not the
Risk Investigations site. If you accessed any other URL or site that
looks like Risk Investigations or if you clicked on a link within an
email to access Risk Investigations and entered your account
information, please change your Password immediately.<br>
<br>
Protect the security of your User Name and Password by following these
guidelines: (a) Never share User Names or Passwords; (b) Do not write
your User Name and Password down anywhere; (c) Install and use current
anti-virus software; (d) Inform your administrator or contact Customer
Support immediately if you believe your User Name or Password have been
compromised.<br>
