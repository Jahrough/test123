LexisNexis&reg; Link ID is an advanced data linking and analysis technology that is the power behind your LexisNexis information solution. It connects the breadth and depth of LexisNexis data sources to bring you relevant, insightful information, so you can make timely and accurate decisions.
<br><br>
You can now search on an individual's Link ID number, a unique, 12-digit identifier that does not contain any personally identifiable information such as a Social Security number (SSN) in order to link and connect data, giving you the maximum degree of protection and data security.
<br><br>
Link ID is often also a better indicator of a unique individual than an SSN because a Link ID number only pulls records associated with a single person. In addition, Link ID is able to link multiple variations of an individual's name (e.g., nicknames, misspellings and maiden names) -- even in cases where an SSN may not be available.
<br><br>
<b>How It Works:</b>
<br><br>
An individual's unique Link ID number is available in Faces of the Nation, People at Work, Phones Plus, Bankruptcy, Liens & Judgments, Drivers of the Nation, Death, Email Address, and Marriage & Divorce Search. You can then click on the Link ID number to initiate a new search where you will gain:
<ul>
  <li>A more precise and current view of an individual.
  <li>An extensive history and known associations.
  <li>Fast, optimum results.
</ul>
