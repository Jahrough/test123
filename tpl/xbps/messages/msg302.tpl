    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    We've made substantial improvements to LexisNexis&reg; Business Search and LexisNexis&reg; Business Comprehensive Report as the result of an extensive investment in a comprehensive, company-wide Business Risk Information infrastructure upgrade.
    <br><br>
    You will benefit from more comprehensive business data coverage and significantly stronger data linking capacity to quickly connect to critical intelligence about businesses and the people associated with the businesses.
    <br><br>
    We've simplified the complexities of business research with smarter functionality and updated usability features that include:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Deeper data coverage</b> for a more complete picture of the company.
      <li><b>Sophisticated search capabilities</b> to help you find what you're looking for.
      <li><b>Reduced "no-hits and not-founds"</b> and fewer false positives means you find your target faster.
      <li><b>Concise, relevant results</b> that display only the best matches.
      <li><b>Clearer report section</b> that supports a quicker assessment of the business associates.
    </ul>

    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    LexisNexis provides an email address-based social networking site search. Clients supply the subject's email address and the Social Network Report will provide a list of all matching social network public-facing pages (URLs) for the search subject in cases where a match to the sites' registered email address is found.
    <br><br>
    Social networking sites are checked for a match against the email address(es) submitted for the search subject.  Matching page results are typically limited to public-facing pages, but often enough useful additional information is provided in these pages that can get the user closer to the subject.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions regarding this enhancement, please contact LexisNexis Customer Support at <b>866.277.8407  or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com/" target="_blank"><u>Email Us</u></b></a>.
