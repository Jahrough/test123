    <br><br>
    The new Motor Vehicle Registration (MVR) Wildcard Search can help private investigators and other <i>Risk Investigations</i> users track down individuals or vehicle owners with partial or incomplete vehicle descriptions and/or license tag numbers.&nbsp; This is a new search you will definitely want to explore for yourself, especially since agencies like yours have been very successful in ending searches or getting one step closer to solving cases.&nbsp; Pricing is the same as what is charged under your current plan for standard (non-wildcard) MVR searches.&nbsp; Note that wildcard search capability is only available for use with in-house data.

    <br><br>
    The new Phone History Report can help private investigators and other <i>Risk Investigations</i> users by providing historical information about landline telephone numbers.&nbsp; The Phone History Report allows users to see up to a 10 year history of a landline phone number including listing name, full address, phone number, connect date and disconnect date.
