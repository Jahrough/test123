<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG>How It

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>When you conduct a 
<EM>Foreclosure</EM> search on an individual or company that yields matching 
results, additional <EM>Notice of Defaults</EM> information is now available in 
search results as well as in the subsequent Foreclosure reports you 
run.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of defaults information is not available in all cases 
where a search subject has a foreclosure &#8211; but is included whenever 
possible.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Inclusion of Notice 
of Defaults information in the Risk Investigations Foreclosure search offers 
you:</FONT></DIV>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial>A more 
  comprehensive view of a Foreclosure subject related to the property (timing of 
  notice, length of time between notice and foreclosure 
  proceedings)</FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The same fast, 
  optimum results &#8211; with additional data included as available in the search at 
  no additional cost</FONT></LI></UL>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial><small>* A Notice of 
Default is a notice to a borrower with property as security under a mortgage or 
deed of trust that he/she is delinquent in payments.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the 
delinquency (money owed and late), plus costs of preparing the legal papers for 
the default, is not paid within a certain time, foreclosure proceedings may be 
commenced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other people with funds secured by the same property are 
usually entitled to receive copies of the notice of default.</FONT></small></DIV>
