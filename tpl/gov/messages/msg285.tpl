    LexisNexis Virtual Identity Search and Report* provides government and law enforcement agencies with an alternate view of an entity, their virtual presence. With this enhanced search functionality, you can determine if a virtual identity or web footprint exists for your person of interest within seconds, without having to access multiple sites -- saving you and your agency significant time and effort. Investigators and researchers can now run a subject's email address within Accurint and determine if that email address is linked to any social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn). Additionally, when you request a Virtual Identity Report in Accurint, you will receive a list of all matching social network and/or virtual identity public-facing pages (URLs) when a match is found between the search subject's email and a site's 'registered' email address.
