    <br><br>
    LexisNexis<sup>&reg;</sup> launched the Accurint<sup>&reg;</sup> Real-Time Phones Search capability within Accurint a couple years ago.&nbsp; The Real-Time Phone Search will help you locate hard-to-find individuals by running simple queries using phone number, address, and other queries based on subject data such as name and social security number.&nbsp; Based on customer feedback and new functionality offerings, we are excited to announce that this search has been  further enhanced to include new display flags and mapping functionality.&nbsp; The enhancement details can be found below.
    <br><br>
    Real-Time Phones Search will now have the ability to display a flag for Probable Current Address, High Risk Address, Active Phone or Possible Disconnected Phone.&nbsp; It will also now have the ability to Map Addresses which is consistent to the functionality with the Map Address Link from the Search Selection Pages.&nbsp; This mapping functionality will display for both in-house and gateway records from our real-time vendor.
    <br><br>
    For more information regarding the enhanced Real-Time Phones Search available on the Main Menu under the Phones section, please contact your account representative with any questions.
    <br><br>
    *The Real-Time Phones Search which is available through Accurint is an add-on feature and will be priced accordingly.&nbsp; Please contact your account representative or LexisNexis Customer Support at 866.277.8407 or <a href="mailto:accurint.support@lexisnexis.com"><b><u>Email Us</u></b></a> for more information.
