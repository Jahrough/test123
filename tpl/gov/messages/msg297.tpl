    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
The Accurint&reg; Sexual Offenders Search has been enhanced with an additional input field to improve your search capabilities and data results.&nbsp; The new Scars/Marks/Tattoos field allows you to enter a description of a physical marking on a subject.&nbsp; This new field is optional and not required to conduct a search.&nbsp; When this field is used, the search results will be sorted with the best-matching records at the top of the list.&nbsp; Using this new field can help you narrow down to particular persons of interest within your investigation.&nbsp; The Scars/Marks/Tattoos field is already displayed in search results, but now you can search by this field within the search criteria.  
<br><br>
In addition, new fields were added to the search results page to display physical characteristics.&nbsp; Records resulting from a Sexual Offenders search will now include, where available, the Height, Weight, and Race of the subject.&nbsp; These fields are also included in the Sexual Offenders report, but now you can see them on the search results page as well.
<br><br>
The enhancements and new functionality are included in all price plans and are enabled at no additional cost to your agency.
<br><br>
Please contact your account representative or call Customer Support at 1-866-277-8407 with any questions or for more information regarding these enhancements in Accurint.
