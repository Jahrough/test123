    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    LexisNexis<span class="sub">&reg;</span> Accurint<span class="sub">&reg;</span> Dynamic Desktop is fully customizable and provides you convenient access to news and articles, person alerts, zip code and area code searches, and now instant messaging.
    <br><br>
    <b>Stay on top of your person alerts</b>
    <br><br>
    We've made the Person Alert feature in Accurint even more convenient by placing those alerts directly on your desktop.&nbsp; Select the Person Alert widget and you will have instant visibility into the most current information on those persons of interest you have selected for alerts.
    <br><br>
    <b>Quick access to helpful tools</b>
    <br><br>
    We understand that sometimes you need quick access to useful information.&nbsp; With Dynamic Desktop, we assembled a collection of handy widgets that you can display and place on your Accurint desktop in the arrangement that works best for you.&nbsp; Use the Area Code Lookup if you have an area code and need to know what geographical area that number sequence covers.&nbsp; Missing a zip code for an address that is going into some paperwork? Simply type the address in the Zip Code Lookup and get instant results.&nbsp; The handy widgets will save you time and will eliminate the need to search in various locations for this information.&nbsp; It's all contained in Accurint and is accessible when and where you need it.
    <br><br>
    <b>Chat with colleagues within your agency</b>
    <br><br>
    Sometimes you have a quick question or tidbit of information for one of your agency colleagues.&nbsp; Use the Chat feature on Dynamic Desktop to send a brief note.&nbsp; Just like other popular instant messaging services, you can see who's online and available and send them a message.&nbsp; It is just another convenient feature to streamline your work and allow you to spend your time focused on your investigations.
