    Motor Vehicle Search and Motor Vehicle Report results will now be sorted in chronological order by registration date and/or title date from most recent to oldest, making the records found within the search results and report more intuitive.&nbsp; This enhancement, which was based on customer feedback, will allow you to search for a registrant, owner or vehicle and return a chronological list that will aid in determining the most current to oldest record.
    <br><br>
    This enhancement is included at no additional cost to your agency.
