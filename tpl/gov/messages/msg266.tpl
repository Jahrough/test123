Motor Vehicle Registration Batch* Now Available</STRONG></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>With release of the online Real-Time Motor Vehicle 
Registration Search/Report, there was an increased interest from government, law 
enforcement, and revenue recovery (parking violation) divisions for this data to 
be accessible via batch.&nbsp; Based on customer feedback, we are excited to 
announce that this same search is now available through our Online Batch 
Interface within Accurint&reg;.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Real-Time Motor Vehicle Registration Batch 
functionality is located within the &#8220;Online Batch Menu&#8221; page.&nbsp; As a 
customer, you can now select the batch menu and quickly run multiple Real-Time 
Motor Vehicle Registration searches at once by walking through the easy-to-use 
online batch steps.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The Real-Time Motor Vehicle Registration Batch 
allows you to run the same search on massive amounts of data at one time.&nbsp; 
This can help your agency locate the owners/registrants of vehicles in question 
through an enhanced, more robust way to process large volumes of vehicle 
registrants.&nbsp; Access is offered to state vehicles registrations that were 
not previously available through a batch solution.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG>If you have any questions regarding this 
new enhancement, please contact your LexisNexis Account Representative or call 
866.277.8407 for more information regarding this new Real-Time Motor Vehicle 
Registration Batch enhancement found within the Online Batch 
Menu.</STRONG></FONT></DIV>
