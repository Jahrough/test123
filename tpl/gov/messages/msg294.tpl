    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    This feature is now more user-friendly than ever!  You can still customize your favorite searches by using the "Add/Remove Tabs" link on the "My Accurint" search screen.&nbsp; Plus, you can now undo a previous customization as well as revert back to the default searches (Advanced Person, Business, Phones, and Vehicles).

    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    The following reports can be found under the "Next Steps" section on search results pages:&nbsp; Relatives Report; Associates Report; Relatives, Neighbors &amp; Associates Report.&nbsp; Each of these reports now contain a note that describes the basic logic used when Accurint linking technology determines relatives and associates linked to a subject.

    <font color="#cc0033" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3"><b>Property Search Enhancements</b></font>
    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    The Property (Property Assessments, Deeds &amp; Mortgages) Search now offers a "Return Physical Property Address Matches Only" option.&nbsp; Selecting this option will limit your search results to only include property address matches for the input street address.&nbsp; This option will not return property records where the input property address matches only the owner address.&nbsp; Also, the "County" field was relocated after the "Zip" field so entering an address is now easier with the field order of Street Address, City, State, Zip, and County.
