    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Dynamic Reports further enhances your Person and Business Comprehensive Reports found within LexisNexis&reg; Accurint&reg; to give you the flexibility to hide, show and rearrange those sections of any given report that you deem essential to your case.&nbsp; It also gives you the flexibility to view and manipulate the answer set to best display your report in an appropriate context relative to the underlying investigation.&nbsp; You can save your preferences through the use of up to four "templates" based on your specific criteria or preference.&nbsp; Additionally, you will have the ability to add notes/comments to reports and print them out as needed.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions regarding the newest enhancement, please contact your LexisNexis Account Representative or Customer Support at 866.277.8407 or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com" target="_blank"><u><b>Email Us</b></u></a>.
