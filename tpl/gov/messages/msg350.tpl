    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">
    In order to enable greater user control, we added a new checkbox <b><i>"Include Full Address History"</i></b> to Advanced Person Search, which will allow you to return full address history -- even when your search criteria are narrow (i.e., when name plus state are entered as search terms).  So, when this box is checked, full address history will be returned, not limited to the address, city and/or state submitted in the search form.
    <br><br>
    Advanced Person Search is a tool that allows you to search broadly for your subject using additional criteria -- such as a relative name or previous state of residence -- or even partial information you might have to more accurately pinpoint where they may be currently located and where they have been.
