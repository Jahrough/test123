    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Now in effect, users with access to full Social Security Numbers (SSNs) will see them partially masked for individuals found within the search results, affecting the first five digits.&nbsp; A user with full access to SSNs will be able to view the last four digits on the initial search results.&nbsp; To obtain the full unmasked SSN users can now click on the <b>unlock SSN icon.</b>&nbsp; This change is being implemented to reduce the exposure of regulated data.
    <br><br>
