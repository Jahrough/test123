    Multi-Factor Functionality is an alternative second factor authentication tool (alternative to Security token).&nbsp; It provides an additional layer of security to protect Accurint data.&nbsp; The feature allows user to receive one time pass code via registered cell phone number allowing them to utilize their cell phones and does not require that the end user have a physical security token to travel with.&nbsp; It also allows for roaming access to be able to view masked data.&nbsp; Users will be able to self-register their own cell phone and carrier information.
