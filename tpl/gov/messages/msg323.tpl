    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Case Connect has expanded the Case Deconfliction feature and now offers the ability to Opt-In subjects from the following search and reports:
    <ul>
      <li>Real-Time Person Search
      <li>People at Work Report
      <li>Other Reports -- Summary Report, Finder Report, Asset Report, Custom Comprehensive Report and Entitlements Report
    </ul>
    Additional enhancements have been made that will allow for more streamlined searches for Case Deconfliction by utilizing new functionality within the "Case Connect -- Case Deconfliction" feature.&nbsp; These features include:
    <ul>
      <li>"Run Deconfliction History" from the Setup Case Deconfliction Alert/Enrollment page -- This allows users to immediately connect with other users of the same permission level that have historical opt-in searches.
      <li>The option to "Refresh" the alert will update the latest information on the subject of investigation.
      <li>An option to set up an "Opt-Out Alert" so that connections are no longer made on the search term that was Opt-In.
      <li>Online notifications (while signed into Accurint) of new Case Deconfliction alerts, such as requests to connect or when another party agrees to connect.
      <li>A new "Manage Subscriber" page will provide a single location to view users that you have established a connection with.&nbsp; Features include:  the ability able to "Block" or "Un-Block" the other parties to prevent future connections and advanced filter options to view recent connections, connections older than 30 days, and non-responsive connections (i.e., the other party has not agreed to connect).
    </ul>
    These enhancements are included in all price plans and are enabled at no additional cost to your agency.
    <br><br>
