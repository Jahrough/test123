<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The Automated Valuation Model (AVM) Search provides 
government agencies a composite report of residential property information, 
which bundles up three valuation models, to provide the best estimate of the 
current market value of the subject property or property of 
interest.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The AVM Historical Data enhancement now expands the 
results beyond the current year and will display historical results going as far 
back as 2004.&nbsp; The primary reason for the enhancement is when investigators 
receive their cases or caseload; most often the files are two to three years 
old.&nbsp; Previously, the AVM search would only showcase a value of property in 
today&#8217;s market.&nbsp; This historical data enhancement will now provide you and 
your agency the ability to view the historical valuations with the present 
view.</FONT></DIV>

questions regarding the new AVM Historical Data enhancement.</FONT></DIV>
