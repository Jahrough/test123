    Based on customer feedback, the latest enhancements described below are designed to make Accurint an even more powerful tool for investigations.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Real-Time Phones Search<sup>*</sup></b> is enhanced with a new <b>Company Name</b> search field.  In addition to phone number and address, you can now also search for business phone listings by the Company Name.  The company name associated to a business phone listing will appear under the NAME/SSN column in search results.</li>
      <li><b>Watercraft Search</b> offers a new <b>Vessel Length</b> field to search for specific watercraft.  A minimum and maximum range can be entered in the measurement of feet.  Search results will also include the Vessel Length in feet.  This new search field is optional and supports a numerical value in either or both of the minimum and maximum fields.  Watercraft records that match the specified length will be sorted to the top of the search results.</li>
