    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Take precautionary steps to identify forged passports.&nbsp; Passport Validation utilizes an algorithm that checks to see if the passport number-letter sequence on the provided passport conforms to published standards and that the information about the holder of the passport (date of birth and gender) matches what is in the passport number.
    <br><br>
    The new Passport Validation analyzes the composition of the passport information and validates whether it uses valid sequences, valid country codes and proper name and gender structure.&nbsp; It does not verify that the passport itself is a validly issued passport.&nbsp; It only validates that the passport number conforms to the standard format.
    <br><br>
    Passport Validation can be found in the People search menu.
