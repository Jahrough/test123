    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    On Friday, January 29, the current Social Network Report search will be replaced with the new and improved Social Media Locator search, priced at $4 per search.
    <br><br>
    The Social Media Locator search makes it easier than ever to capture an individual's digital footprint.  Manually searching multiple social network sites for fresh social media content takes considerable time and effort.  Instead, the Social Media Locator search uses hundreds of social networks and millions of websites to match and build results, all in just one search.  Results are categorized and ordered by how strong the match is to your search, and you easily access web pages from the URLs listed in search result.
    <br><br>
    Look for the new Social Media Locator search under the "People" tab, and try it beginning January 29!
