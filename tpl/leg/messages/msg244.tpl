<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>LexisNexis carefully protects the information 
contained in our databases.&nbsp; In order to further safeguard that 
information, we have recently changed the permissible use display that is 
presented to users before they are permitted to perform any searches in a public 
records source. Availability to public record sources is regulated by federal, 
state and local governments. Effective August 20, 2009 only the permissible uses 
certified to by your company in its contract with LexisNexis will be displayed 
and available for selection.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Two permissible use screens will continue to be 
displayed after you have selected your public records source and prior to the 
execution of your search.&nbsp; Complete both screens to select your valid 
permissible use and your search results will then be returned.&nbsp; If you have 
any questions or concerns about what permissible use to choose you should 
contact your company&#8217;s System Administrator.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>After you have selected your permissible uses, 
these selections will persist throughout your research session.&nbsp; If you no 
longer have a permissible use, or the applicable permissible use changes, you 
select the appropriate permissible uses.&nbsp; To change your permissible uses, 
select the hyperlinked permissible use located at the bottom of the search 
screen.&nbsp; You will be taken back to the two GLBA and DPPA permissible use 
screens, where you can revise your selections and continue with your 
search.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>LexisNexis is pleased to offer comprehensive public 
records data that is well protected, and we appreciate your understanding of the 
importance of data security.&nbsp; Please contact your Account Representative 
directly or Customer Support at 1-866-277-8407 with any questions or
