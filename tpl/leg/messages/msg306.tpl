    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Effective March 26, 2014, the Social Security Administration began limiting the availability of the Death Master File (DMF).&nbsp; The Death Master File record of all individuals with dates of death of March 26, 2014 and later are withheld for three years after date of death.
    <br><br>
    A certification process was issued by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) in late March, 2014.&nbsp; LexisNexis received NTIS certification, which will enable us to provide to qualified customers DMF deceased records provided by the NTIS with a date of death on or after March 26, 2014.
    <br><br>
    Pursuant to the NTIS's subscriber certification agreement and license agreement for use of this DMF data, in order for LexisNexis to be able to provide this data to our customers, we must:
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure our customers have a permissible purpose under Section 203 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 to access the Limited Access DMF data;
      <li>Contract with our customers to ensure they will comply with the terms of the License Agreement; and
      <li>Ensure our customers have systems, facilities and procedures in place to safeguard the DMF information and experience in maintaining the confidentiality, security, and appropriate use of such information.
    </ul>
    As previously announced, in order to allow access to the Limited Access Death Master File data, we ask that the user administrator (or other individual authorized to execute documents for your organization) sign the <a href="http://www.accurint.com/pdf/DMF_Addendum.pdf" target="_blank"><b><u>Addendum for Access to Limited Access DMF Data.</b></u></a>
    <br><br>
    If the user administrator or other authorized individual for your account fails to sign this contract addendum, or if you otherwise do not have a permissible purpose to obtain the Limited Access Death Master File data, you will still have access to the following deceased-record data from LexisNexis:
    <ul>
      <li>DMF deceased records provided by the NTIS to LexisNexis with a date of death prior to March 26, 2014.
      <li>DMF deceased records provided by the NTIS to LexisNexis with a date of death on or after March 26, 2014 where date of death is a minimum of 3 years in the past from the current day's date.
      <li>All non-DMF data contained in the LexisNexis deceased-record database
    </ul>
    This data embargo will impact all LexisNexis products that contain DMF data including but not limited to database searches, scores, reports and flags associated with deceased individuals.
    <br><br>
    Once your user administrator (or other individual authorized to sign for your account) has signed the attached Addendum for Access to Limited DMF Data, you may either return the signed copy to your account representative or submit it directly to LexisNexis via email to <a href="mailto:DMF.Contract@lexisnexis.com"><b><u>DMF.Contract@lexisnexis.com</b></u></a>.
    <br><br>
    Tips to facilitate your addendum:
    <ol>
      <li>Individual users within the account should not sign the addendum, but instead just one addendum should be signed by the user administrator or other authorized signatory on behalf of the entire account.
      <li>Verify that the account name that you use on the addendum is the same name that LexisNexis has on record for your account (check your monthly invoice to confirm).
      <li>List on the addendum or on a separate document all the account numbers that are covered by the addendum.&nbsp; If you utilize a separate document to list all the account numbers that are covered by the addendum, be sure to submit that document in the same email as your completed addendum.
      <li>Submit the addendum and any separate documentation in one email to <a href="mailto:DMF.Contract@lexisnexis.com"><b><u>DMF.Contract@lexisnexis.com</b></u></a>.
    </ol>
    If you do not have a permissible purpose, or do not wish to receive the updated DMF data, or if you are not the user admin or other authorized signatory for your account, you should not sign or return the addendum.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions, please contact your account representative or Customer Support at 866.277.8407.
