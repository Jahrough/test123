<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In our ongoing efforts to improve Accurint, we continue to add content and 
make enhancements to the product to make locating people even easier. The 
telephone number search results now include the abbreviation for the Time Zone 
corresponding to phone number. This additional information is helpful for 
pre-call planning.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The nine standard time zones for the United States are: Atlantic Standard 
Time (AST), Eastern Standard Time (EST), Central Standard Time (CST), Mountain 
Standard Time (MST), Pacific Standard Time (PST), Alaskan Standard Time (AKST), 
Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (HAST), Samoa standard time (UTC-11), Chamorro 
Standard Time (UTC+10).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>From the second Sunday in March through the first Sunday in November 
abbreviations for the areas on Daylight Saving Time will change in each time 
zone change along with Daylight Saving Time. Eastern Standard Time (EST) becomes 
Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), and so forth. Arizona, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, U.S. 
Virgin Islands and American Samoa do not observe Daylight Saving Time.</DIV>
