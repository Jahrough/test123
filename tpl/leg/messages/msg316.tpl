    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    LexisNexis continuously evaluates our product offerings to meet customer needs.  With the launch of the enhanced Social Media Locator search, we are retiring the Social Network Report.  The new Social Media Locator stands out in terms of content, coverage, search capabilities and customer service. The search checks hundreds of social media sites and millions of websites, including deep web, for matching and building of results with just one click, saving you time and increasing your search efficiency.
    <br><br>

    <font color="#ed1c24" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="3"><b>MORE Flexibility and Control with LexisNexis&reg; Advanced Person Search</b></font>
    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    A new checkbox "Include Full Address History" has been added to Advanced Person Search to provide you greater control of historical address views -- even when your search criteria is narrow (i.e., when name plus state are entered as search terms). So, when this box is checked, full address history will be returned, not limited to the address, city and/ or state submitted in the search form.
    <br><br>
    Advanced Person Search allows you to search broadly for your subject using additional criteria -- such as a relative name or previous state of residence -- or even partial information to more accurately pinpoint where they may reside.
    <br><br>
    *Search Tips have also been updated in the application (below the search form).
