    LexisNexis Secure Image allows you to register a secret image, phrase, and border color that only you know.&nbsp; This image is then presented to you as validation that you are accessing an authentic Accurint site.&nbsp; When you log in from a previously unknown device, you will be prompted to provide supplemental authentication (answer your security question) prior to being presented with the image display.
    <br><br>
    To enable this security feature, please go to "Change password", set your security question and select your login image and immediately protect your access to Accurint services.
