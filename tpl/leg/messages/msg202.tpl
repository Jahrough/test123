The Contact Card Report provides a new way to obtain instant access to
key contact information available on an individual! Now you can easily
identify relatives and associates, as well as determine their
relationship (mother, brother, father, etc.) to your subject. <br>
<br>
Save time!&nbsp; Instead of running multiple searches, access Contact Card
directly from your Person Search or Advanced Person Search results. <br>
<br>
Accurint can instantly find people, as well as their assets, relatives,
associates, and more. The underlying Accurint technology provides more
extensive linking capabilities than anyone else in the industry,
creating deeper and more accurate reports on individuals and businesses.<br>
<br>
Investigation of the facts is as important as researching the law. When
it comes to locating information on people and businesses, the legal
profession requires instant access to the most accurate and current
information.<br>
