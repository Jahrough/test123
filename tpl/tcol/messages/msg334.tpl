    A new input field called "Full Case Number" will now appear in the Bankruptcy Search Form, BK Court Links, and Banko Events. The current Case Number field has changed to "Abbreviated Case Number."
    <br><br>
    This change comes about due to changing industry standards regarding the use of Bankruptcy case numbers. The initial standard case number was a seven digit numerical input value and an abbreviated version of a full case number. Today, courts are beginning to use their full case numbers as standard without including an abbreviated version. Full case numbers usually contain dashes and are often alphanumerical. An example of a Full Case Number is: 3:14-bk-12345-BHR.  Where the abbreviated version of that same case number is: 14-12345.  However, the full case number format is not standardized across the US, or even across the state at times.
    <br><br>
    Today, customers will have a choice when searching by case number to search by the abbreviated version or the full version on all Banko&reg; Products: Bankruptcies, BK Court Links, or Banko Events.
