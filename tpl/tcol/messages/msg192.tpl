Take a moment to check out our enhanced Corporation Filings Search.&nbsp;
We&#8217;ve rolled up the corporation filings to the Charter Number, allowing
you to pull just one Corporation Report for all of the filings on that
Charter Number.&nbsp; We have also added the name type to the search results
which, when returned, will reveal if it is the Company&#8217;s legal or trade
name.&nbsp; Remember, you can run a Comprehensive Business Report right from
the search results to find out additional details such as Business
Registrations, UCC filings, Liens and Judgments, Assets and more.
