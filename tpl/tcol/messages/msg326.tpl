    LexisNexis&reg; Risk Solutions continues to update and improve our data in order to provide the best possible service and support to our customers. Effective the week of April 8th, LexisNexis&reg; will enhance the results for Motor Vehicle Searches and Reports to return additional VIN data in existing fields. Users may notice different, more descriptive values returned during searches that contain motor vehicle information relating to the following fields:
    <ul>
      <li>Body Type Description
      <li>Make Description
      <li>Fuel Type
    </ul>
    This enhancement will also add many new VIN records to our database. Users may notice a higher hit rate and increased effectiveness across motor vehicle and VIN searches after the release.
    <br><br>
