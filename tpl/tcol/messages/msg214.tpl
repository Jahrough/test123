<DIV><BR>Thank you for your continued participation in the Phone Feedback Beta 
Test.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We have received over 13,000 feedback submissions since the start of the 
test on April 18, 2008. We are currently analyzing and validating the feedback 
received to ensure its accuracy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The results of our analysis will assist us in determining whether we 
release this new feature in an effort to obtain feedback from all Accurint for 
Collections users. By making the feedback results available we will provide our 
users with more intelligence on the phone numbers we return.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Again, thank you for your participation and please continue to provide your 
feedback during this testing period.</DIV>
