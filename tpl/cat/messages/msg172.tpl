<big><b>We listened,
PhonesPlus has been improved!</b></big><br>
<br>
Customer feedback told us we needed to make changes to PhonesPlus to
improve hit rate and reduce disconnected numbers.&nbsp; To respond, we
changed our scoring algorithm, implemented sophisticated screening
logic to reduce disconnected numbers and added more than 8 million
possible cell phones.&nbsp; With PhonesPlus you can now search more than 98
million phone numbers not currently found in Electronic Directory
Assistance.<br>

<br>
<small><font face="Verdana">Information available through the Phones
Plus feature may not be used for marketing solicitation or similar
purpose. Service contains cell phone numbers. The Telephone Consumer
Protection Act (47 U.S.C sec 227) prohibits uses of automatic telephone
dialing systems to make any call to any cellular telephone service or
any other service for which the called party is charged for the call.<br>
