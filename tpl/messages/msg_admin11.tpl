    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">
    <br><br>
    There is a new security feature available which allows you to control the email domain(s) used for administrative purposes in connection with your account.&nbsp; The primary goal of this option is to increase ID and account security by restricting which email domains may be used by users.&nbsp; The effect of applying this feature is to prevent unauthorized individuals from directing notification and security emails to email servers not controlled by you.&nbsp; This feature reduces the risk that emails intended to notify the legitimate user of ID/account changes or unusual activities are diverted to an inappropriate recipient.&nbsp; To begin restricting email domains for your account click "Yes" for Enable Email Domains located in the Manage Company tab and then enter your desired email domain.
    <br><br> 
    For more information on how to enable this feature, please contact your Sales representative or contact Customer Support at 1-866-277-8407 or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com/" target="_blank"><b><u>Email Us</u></b></a>.
