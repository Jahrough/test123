    <br><br>

    In our efforts to continue to provide the secure, quality service that
    our customers are accustomed to receiving, we will be implementing
    additional security measures this week.

    <br><br>

    Those security measures include:

    <br>

    <ul>

    <li> Removing the Login ID and Password entry fields from the
         <TMPL_IF IRB>IRBSearch<TMPL_ELSE>Accurint</TMPL_IF> Home Page and moving them to a secondary page. You
         will access the Login Page by simply clicking on the
         "Account Login" button on the <TMPL_IF IRB>IRBSearch<TMPL_ELSE>Accurint</TMPL_IF> Home page.

    <br>

    <li> Removing the "Save Password" checkbox from the Login Page.

    <br>

    <li> Adding a verification image to the Login Page. This new
         security measure is human-readable-only characters that
         must be entered into a box. When logging in you will be
         required to enter three (3) pieces of information; your
         login ID, your password, and the characters displayed in
         the verification image.
    
    </ul>

    <br>

    All of these measures are designed to protect your account from
    unauthorized use, as well as protect the information we provide from
    unauthorized access.  We appreciate your continued support and apologize
    for any inconvenience these new security measures may cause.

    <br><br>
 
    Thank you for your support.
