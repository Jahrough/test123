    <b>Aug 11, 2010:</b>&nbsp; Many customers have reported receiving an email with subject line "account update", asking them to login and then install software "updatetool.exe" to "make your online experience safer and more enjoyable." We will never ask you to install software -- this email is a fraudulent one, and you should delete it immediately.
    <br><br>
    If you installed the "updatetool.exe" software, your computer may be infected with malware and you need to have your computer checked and cleaned immediately. To determine if your computer is infected you will need to run an anti-virus application such as McAfee, Norton or Avira on your computer and remove any malware detected. Please contact your company system administrator if you need assistance.
    <br><br>
    If you ONLY have an <b>INFECTED PC</b>, we recommend you change your password by calling customer service at <TMPL_IF IRB>1-800-447-2112<TMPL_ELSE>1-866-277-8407</TMPL_IF>.
    <br><br>
    If you have a <b>NON-INFECTED PC</b> you can change your password online by following the steps below:
    <ol>
      <li>Sign in using your old password from a <b>NON-INFECTED PC.</b></li>
      <li>From the Main Menu, click on "Change Password" link in the "My Account" section.<br></li>
      <li>If prompted, input your OLD password again to gain access.</li>
      <li>On the change password page, please input your OLD password followed by the NEW password in the following two fields.</li>
      <li>Click the "Save" button to update to your NEW password.</li>
      <li>Please <b>DO NOT</b> sign in to this or any other service from the <b>INFECTED PC</b> until it has been cleared of all infections.</li>
    </ol>
