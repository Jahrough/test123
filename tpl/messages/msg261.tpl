<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">
<br><br>
All Internet users should be aware of the online scam known as "phishing" (pronounced "fishing"). Phishing involves the use of e-mail messages that appear to come from your bank or another trusted business such as Accurint, but are actually from imposters.  All your Accurint business web access should be done through our secure Web site.  <b>We will not send you an e-mail with links to our site, nor will we provide you links to download software to your computer.</b>  Please click <a href="http://www.accurint.com/scam_alert.html" target="_blank"><b><u>http://www.accurint.com/scam_alert.html</u></b></a> for more information and learn how to protect yourself.
<br><br>
Always start login from: <b>http://www.accurint.com</b> and never enter your ID or Password information at any other URL or site, or your security may be compromised. Never click or follow links to Accurint from email messages because if you do so you may be taken to a site that looks like Accurint but is not the Accurint site. If you accessed any other URL or site that looks like Accurint or if you clicked on a link within an email to access Accurint and entered your account information, please change your Password immediately.
<br><br>
Protect the security of your User Name and Password by following these guidelines: (a) Never share User Names or Passwords; (b) Do not write your User Name and Password down anywhere; (c) Install and use current anti-virus software; (d) Inform your administrator or contact Customer Support immediately if you believe your User Name or Password have been compromised.
