<DIV><BR>The nationwide Court Search enables you to obtain civil and criminal 
histories for the subject you select without ever having to leave your 
office.&nbsp; The search provides a possible address history for your subject 
and an easy-to-use wizard to help you identify the county, state, and federal 
court searches available for your subject.&nbsp; To refine your search, a 
customization feature allows you to choose the state, county, and federal 
district.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The per-search price and order total will be displayed once you've chosen 
the searches you want, allowing you to review your order and determine whether 
you want to proceed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The State of New York has raised their court access fee and as a result the 
price of our New York Statewide Court Search will increase by an additional 
$3.00 effective May 29, 2008.</DIV>
