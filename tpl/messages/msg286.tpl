    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    The Social Security Administration (SSA) will begin using a random approach to assign Social Security numbers (SSNs) on June 25, 2011.&nbsp; While LexisNexis does not expect this change to impact the majority of online users and usage cases, we have updated certain logic and message indicators to provide additional clarification in these cases.
    <br><br>
    SSNs which were previously noted as invalid because they did not match a published block group will now be identified as possibly randomly issued by the SSA.&nbsp; SSNs with a non-valid format (e.g., contains letters, begins with "9") or does not match a valid block group prior to June 25, 2011 will continue to be notified as invalid.
