    Invaluable investigatory data exists on the internet about those who share information on themselves - blogs, photos, social networks, videos, etc.  In response to customer feedback, an enhanced social media search is now available.  Social Media Locator will provide instant access to a comprehensive social media and web profile view for subjects of interest.  Save time and money by avoiding tedious manual searching.  The powerful linking algorithms of Social Media Locator will allow you to search using a multitude of search input fields to quickly find publically available content on individuals, organizations and businesses.
    <br><br>
    If you have minimal information, Social Media Locator can be accessed as an add-on option to Person Search, Advanced Person Search, Email Search or Phones Plus.  Clicking on the Social Media Locator option, from any one of these searches, will carry over search result information to the Social Media Locator.  After information populates in Social Media Locator, additional search input criteria can be entered before running the search.
