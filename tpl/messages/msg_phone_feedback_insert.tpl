    <big><b>CONGRATULATIONS!</b></big> You have been selected by LexisNexis to participate in an Accurint for Collections Phone Feedback beta project.<br><br>

This groundbreaking beta project will allow select users to provide LexisNexis with feedback on the telephone numbers returned in the Accurint for Collections search results after the telephone number has been called. This feedback will be used to enhance the LexisNexis database in an attempt to provide more insight on the telephone numbers we return to you.
<br><br>
The new <b>Phone Feedback</b> option provides valuable information, directly from our online users, on the relevance of telephone search results. Through the  <b>Phone Feedback</b> online users select from a menu to rate the telephone number returned on the Accurint for Collections search results page. After the call, simply click on the <b>Feedback</b> button, located below the telephone number on the search results pages, to choose the phone type from a series of options including:
<ul>
<li>Right Party Contact</li>
<li>Relative or Associate</li>
<li>Wrong Party Claim</li>
<li>Phone Disconnected</li>
<li>Alternate Phone</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
<br>
Thank you for your participation and we look forward to your feedback!
