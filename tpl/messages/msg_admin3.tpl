You can delete inactive users in four easy steps:
<ol>
<li>Go to the "My Account" section</li>
<li> Click on "Manager Users"</li>
<li>Select the user you want to delete (you can choose to view "all", "active" or "suspended" users)</li>
<li> Click the "Delete" button</li>
</ol>
Note: Once deleted, you cannot re-activate a user. Instead, you will have to create a new user.<br><br>
