Feature!</b></big><br>
<br>
The <b>Business Search</b> now includes a <b>Radius option</b>.&nbsp; Now
you can locate a company and any additional locations within a
specified geographical area. If you do not know a Company&#8217;s city but
know the general vicinity, you can use the radius option. Enter the
company&#8217;s name, a ZIP code, or a nearby city and state, and provide a
radius (in miles) in the <b>Radius</b> field. &nbsp;<br>

<big><b>Additional Criminal Records!</b></big> <br>
<br>
We have added two new arrest log counties to our Criminal Records
Search.&nbsp; In addition to those already online, you can now search arrest
logs for Kent and Macomb counties in Michigan.
