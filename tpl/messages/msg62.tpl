    <b>People at Work - More Data and New Features!!</b>
    <ul>We have added over 30 million additional people to our People at Work search allowing you to now search more than 105 million unique individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The search results include our confidence in the linkage between the person and the business (high, medium, or low) along with the date ranges that we've associated them.</ul>

    <ul>We have also added a new blue check mark to the search results indicating that the phone number for the displayed business is currently active.</ul>

    <ul>The search results are now sorted to bring the information you're looking for to the top.&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses with active phone listings are displayed first, sorted by confidence level of the linkage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next come the high-confidence links, sorted by date ranges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then medium and low confidence links.</ul>

    <ul><strong>People at Work Search Tip:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you search for a person by social security number and don't find the results you're looking for, try searching by the person's name along with a city and state.  In many cases, you will find People at Work records for the person using this method.</ul>
