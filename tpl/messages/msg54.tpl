    <b>You've been providing suggestions on how to improve Accurint and we've been listening!!</b>
    <ul>
    <b>New, Faster Main Menu!</b>
    <br><br>
    Based on your suggestions, we have redesigned the Main Menu to make Accurint even easier to use.
    <br><br>
    <b>Flat-Rate Comprehensive Report Options!</b>
    <br><br>
    Many suggestions have come in to allow for the selection of options on our flat-rate comprehensive report.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now turn on as many options as you wish and get your $4.50 report.&nbsp;&nbsp;No more unwanted information getting in your way.
    </ul>
    <b>But that's not all!&nbsp;&nbsp;We have added several other new enhancements this week as well.</b>
    <ul>
    <b>Person Search!</b>
    <br><br>
    You can now search an address using only partial street numbers using our wildcard feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you wish to find all people on Main Street that have house numbers that start with 12, simply type in 12* Main St and we will return all matches such as 123 Main St. , 12286 Main St. and 12240 Main St.
    <br><br>
    <b>Department of Corrections Photos!</b>
    <br><br>
    We now have over 700,000 Department of Correction photos for six states available in Accurint.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can search for criminal convictions and view photos along with the conviction report in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, and Oklahoma.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no additional charge for these photos!
    <br><br>
    <b>New Sexual Offender States!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have added two additional states to the sexual offender search.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 36 states already online, you can now search for sexual offenders in Missouri and Ohio.
    <br><br>
    <b>New Professional License Types!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have added additional license types in Connecticut and Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these, we have also added IRS Enrolled Agents as license types in all states.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be sure to check the coverage for a list of all states covered and license types available.
    <br><br>
    <b>New Official Records Counties!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have added four additional counties to the official records search.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 15 counties already online, you can now search for official records in Alachua, Citrus and St. Lucie counties in Florida and Riverside County in California.
