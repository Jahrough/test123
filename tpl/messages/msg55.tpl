    <b>Our Business Report has been Redesigned to Make it More Comprehensive and Easier to Use!</b>
    <ul>
    <b>Business Associations!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have added new linking technology which will not only give you other businesses linked with the business on which you searched but also show you details on how the businesses are associated.
    <br><br>
    <b>Dun & Bradstreet Reports!</b>
    <br><br>
    To enhance your report, you can also select the "Dun &amp; Bradstreet Records" checkbox on the menu screen, and for an additional charge of $3.75, we'll include those records in your Business Report.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lower Prices!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have reduced some of the options on the Business Report enabling you to run a complete business report for a maximum of only $10.00 (including Dun &amp; Bradstreet), depending on the options you select.
    </ul>
    <b>Additional Enhancements!</b>
    <ul>
    <b>New Civil Court Counties!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have added two additional counties to our Civil Court search.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 11 counties already online, you can now search for civil court cases in Cook County, Illinois, and Lake County, Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to check the coverage for case type descriptions and start dates.
    <br><br>
    <b>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Search!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have added an additional search for Dun &amp; Bradstreet businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;To access this search, select the Dun &amp; Bradstreet option under the Business menu.
    <br><br>
    <b>Department of Correction Photos are now Available on the Comprehensive Report!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have now added the 700,000 Department of Correction photos to the Comprehensive Report in addition to the Criminal Conviction Report.
    <br><br>
    <b>Low-bandwidth Accurint!</b>
    <br><br>
    For those of you with slower access to the Internet, we have added the ability to turn on a low-bandwidth version of Accurint.&nbsp;&nbsp;To access this option, select "Other User Settings" from the Preferences menu item in the My Account section in Accurint.
