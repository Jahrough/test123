<big><b>We&#8217;ve enhanced our Bankruptcy Search and Report!</b></big>
<br><br>
As part of our ongoing effort to provide our customers with the most
current technology and data, we have made changes to our Bankruptcy
Search.&nbsp; We will now roll up the Bankruptcy filings to the Case Number
which will put all of the filings for a particular case together in the
Bankruptcy Report.&nbsp; A separate search box for searching by FEIN has
been added, as well as additional search logic allowing us to return a
potential SSN for some subjects.&nbsp; Remember, you can also find the link
to Real Time Dockets and Images at the top of the Bankruptcy Report.
