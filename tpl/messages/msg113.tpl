    <b>SECURITY ALERT</b>
    <br><br>

    Recently, it has come to our attention that customers may have
    received suspicious emails from "<TMPL_IF IRB>IRBSearch<TMPL_ELSE>Accurint</TMPL_IF>". The suspicious
    email contains a hyperlink that looks like the <TMPL_IF IRB>IRBSearch<TMPL_ELSE>Accurint</TMPL_IF> web site
    but links instead to a similar sounding site that may ask the
    customer to verify their account information.

    <br><br>

    <TMPL_IF IRB>IRBSearch<TMPL_ELSE>Accurint</TMPL_IF> will not ask for your account access information via
    email. Please keep your login id and password confidential. If
    you are contacted about your <TMPL_IF IRB>IRBSearch<TMPL_ELSE>Accurint</TMPL_IF> account access information
    via e-mail please delete that e-mail.

    <br><br>
 
    Thank you for your support.
