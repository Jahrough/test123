    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Some of our customers communicated to us that the Social Network Report search was not available in the main menu.&nbsp; We heard your feedback and are pleased to announce you can now utilize our social networking site search.
    <br><br>
    To access the search, select Social Network Report in the People section and enter the subject's email address.&nbsp; Social Network Report will provide a list of all matching social network public-facing pages (URLs) for the search subject in cases where a match to the sites' registered email address is found.
    <br><br>
    Account Administrators can turn off Social Network Report features through the "Manage Company" and "Manage User" tabs within "My Account" settings.
    <br><br>
