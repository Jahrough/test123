    <b>To our valued System Administrators:</b>
    <br><br>
    As we announced, LexisNexis is implementing several heightened security measures.  Effective today, we will begin to prompt users to change their passwords every 90 days. They will be prompted to enter their old password, select a new password and then confirm their new password.  This will re-occur for all users, by default, every 90 days.<br><br>
    In the event your users forget their passwords, you or another system administrator must reset the password with a temporary one.  In order to set a temporary password, follow these steps:
    <ul>
    <li>On the Main Menu, select <b>Manage Users</b></li>
    <li>Click on the user's <b>Login ID</b></li>
    <li>In the <b>Update User</b> form, enter and confirm the new temporary password</li>
    <li>Click the <b>Update User</b> button</li>
    </ul>
    Upon login, this user will be prompted to input the temporary password, and then select and confirm a new password.  As a reminder, users will be suspended after five (5) unsuccessful login attempts and required to contact their System Administrator to ensure security and appropriate reactivation.<br><br>
    LexisNexis looks forward to working together with you to ensure privacy and appropriate use of our products.<TMPL_UNLESS NAME="XBPS">  Should you have any questions regarding our enhanced security measures, please email Product Support at <a href="mailto:Accurint.Support@lexisnexis.com">Accurint.Support@lexisnexis.com</a>.</TMPL_UNLESS>
