<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Due to recent legislation regarding Social Security 
Number masking in the State of Minnesota (SF 2390), LexisNexis has implemented a 
policy to further maintain the integrity and privacy of the Social Security 
Number in all US states. Effective June 26th, 2008, customers who are eligible 
to receive unmasked social security numbers<SPAN 
class=174310314-05062008>,</SPAN> will no longer receive full unmasked social 
security numbers in their responses from LexisNexis unless the customer has a 
permissible Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) purpose for the inquiry and selects 
(or if applicable preselects) that purpose.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>For customers that have a permissible 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) purpose for the inquiry and do select 
appropriately that purpose, there will be no change to social security number 
masking.</FONT></DIV>
