    <b>Accurint Introduces a New Phone Batch!</b>
    <ul>We have created a new phone batch that gives you greater flexibility in obtaining phone numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can "dial in" the matching criteria and data we search based on your individual needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you want only directory assistance phone numbers, simply choose level one.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if you want us to do a broader search and return a "possible" current phone number if none others are found, choose level four.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you only want new phone numbers, select the "Return Different Phone" option and pay a lower price.<br><br>Try our new Phone Batch today and see better results!&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply click on Phone Batch on the People Main Menu item.</ul>
    <b>People at Work gets more data!</b>
    <ul>In our continuous efforts to make the People at Work search even better, we've added an additional 30 million new records to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now search for business links for more than 132 million individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep your eyes open for additional enhancements coming.</ul>
    <b>Additional Court Records!</b>
    <ul>We have added two additional counties to our Criminal Court Records.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 16 states and 33 counties already online, you can now search for court records in El Paso County, Texas, and Fairfax County, Virginia.</ul>
