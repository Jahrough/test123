  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG>Create separate user 
  accounts.</STRONG>&nbsp; The more people that have access to your files the 
  greater the risk that someone else may accidentally access, modify, and/or 
  delete your files.&nbsp; The best way to protect your data is to have your 
  access and account separate from other users.&nbsp; Only one (1) account per 
  person.</FONT><br><br></LI>

  adequately erase sensitive files.</FONT><br><br></LI></UL>
