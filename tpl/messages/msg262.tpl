ID</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>LexisNexis&reg; Link ID is an advanced data linking and 
analysis technology that is the power behind your LexisNexis information 
solution. It connects the breadth and depth of LexisNexis data sources to bring 
you relevant, insightful information, so you can make timely and accurate 
decisions.<BR><BR>You can now search on an individual&#8217;s Link ID number, a 
unique, 12-digit identifier that does not contain any personally identifiable 
information such as a Social Security number (SSN) in order to link and connect 
data, giving you the maximum degree of protection and data security.<BR><BR>Link 
ID is often also a better indicator of a unique individual than an SSN because a 
Link ID number only pulls records associated with a single person. In addition, 
Link ID is able to link multiple variations of an individual&#8217;s name (e.g., 
nicknames, misspellings and maiden names)&#8212;even in cases where an SSN may not be 
available.<BR><BR><b>How It Works:</b><BR><BR>An individual&#8217;s unique Link ID number is
