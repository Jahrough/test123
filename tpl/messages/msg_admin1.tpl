    <b>To our valued System Administrators:</b>
    <br><br>
    LexisNexis considers the protection of personal information a top priority. As recent events have indicated, identity thieves have become more sophisticated in their fraud schemes. All of us - customers and information providers - must be vigilant in maintaining and adhering to data security protocols and privacy policies.
    <br></br>
    Effective immediately, heightened password security protocols for all products will be implemented for System Administrators and Users to support secure systems and the responsible use of data.  An overview of our current and enhanced security measures include:
    <ul>
    <li>Login IDs and passwords cannot be the same and the password cannot contain the login ID.</li>
    <li>All new Login IDs created must be at least six (6) characters long.</li>
    <li>Passwords for both System Administrators and Users will be required to change at least every 90 days.</li>
    <li>Users who have been inactive for 90 days will be suspended and required to contact their System Administrator to ensure security and appropriate reactivation.</li>
    <li>System Administrators who have been inactive for 90 days will be suspended and required to contact Product Support to ensure security and appropriate reactivation.</li>
    <li>System Administrators will be suspended after five (5) unsuccessful login attempts and required to contact Product Support to ensure security and appropriate reactivation.</li>
    <li>Users will be suspended after five (5) unsuccessful login attempts and required to contact their System Administrator to ensure security and appropriate reactivation.</li>
    <li>All suspended System Administrators and Users that have been reactivated must change their password at their next login.</li>
    </ul>
    LexisNexis looks forward to working together with you to ensure privacy and appropriate use of our products.<TMPL_UNLESS NAME="XBPS">  Should you have any questions regarding our enhanced security measures, please email Product Support at <a href="mailto:Accurint.Support@lexisnexis.com">Accurint.Support@lexisnexis.com</a>.</TMPL_UNLESS>
