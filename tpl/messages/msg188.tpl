Never click or follow links to Accurint from email messages. The
links contained in emails can appear to be sending you to a site you
trust, such as Accurint.com, but actually take you to a malicious
web site that may LOOK like Accurint but is trying to steal your ID
and password. If you do follow those links and interact with the
malicious web sites, your account may be compromised.

<br/><br/>

Always login from: http://www.accurint.com and never enter ID or
Password information at any other URL or site.

<br/><br/>

If you accessed any other URL or site that looks like Accurint or if
you clicked on a link within an email to access Accurint and entered
your account information, please change your Password immediately.

<br/><br/>

What to do if you believe you've received a phishing scam:
<br/>
<ul>
    <li> Do not click on links in the e-mail.
    <li> Report the phishing e-mail or Web site to Accurint customer service at <a href="mailto:report_phishing@accurint.com">report_phishing@accurint.com</a>
</ul>

<br/>

What to do if you believe you've clicked on a link from a phishing scam and entered your account information:
<br/>
<ul>
    <li> Change your password immediately.
    <li> Monitor your account usage carefully.
    <li> Contact Accurint Customer Service immediately at 1-800-543-6862.
