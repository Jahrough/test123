<b>NEW STATES ADDED TO
NATIONWIDE COURT SEARCH!</b><br>
<br>
We are pleased to announce the addition of five states to our
nationwide Court Search &#8211; Arkansas, Delaware, Iowa, New Mexico, and
Wyoming. Providing coverage for these states brings our total offline
court search coverage to 30 states.&nbsp; The nationwide Court Search
enables you to obtain civil and criminal histories for the subject you
select without ever having to leave your office.&nbsp; The search provides a
possible address history for your subject and an easy-to-use wizard to
help you identify the county, state, and federal court searches
available for your subject.&nbsp; To refine your search, we have added a
customization feature allowing you to choose the state, county, and
federal district.<br>

<br>
The per-search price and order total will be displayed once you&#8217;ve
chosen the searches you want, allowing you to review your order and
determine whether you want to proceed.<br>
<br>
Price changes will occur for the following states:&nbsp; Florida &#8211; from
$32.50 to $35.50; Indiana &#8211; from $28.00 to $30.00; Kansas &#8211; from $26.50
to $30.00; Kentucky &#8211; from $23.50 to $37.50; Montana &#8211; from $26.50 to
$27.50; and South Carolina &#8211; from $37.50 to $47.50.&nbsp; The pricing for
our county-level searches remains unchanged; however, we will begin
passing along the applicable court access fees. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL LICENSE TYPES!</b> <br>

Our coverage of professional licenses has expanded with additional
