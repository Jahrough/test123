<b>Security Tip:  How to Secure Your Computer</b>
<font size="-1">
<ul>
  <li><b>Implement and maintain anti-virus, anti-malware software and firewalls.</b><br>Protect yourself against viruses and Trojan horses that may steal or modify the data on your own computer and leave you vulnerable.  Check your anti-virus software and your firewall regularly to update the programs definitions.<br><br></li>
  <li><b>Regularly scan your computers for spyware.</b><br>Spyware or adware hidden in software programs may affect the performance of your computer and give attackers access to your data.<br><br></li>
  <li><b>Keep Software up to date.</b><br>Hackers will attack known problems or vulnerabilities.  Protect your computer by regularly checking for updates and installing your operating systems automatic updates.<br><br></li>
  <li><b>Create separate user accounts.</b><br>The more people that have access to your files the greater the risk that someone else may accidentally access, modify, and/or delete your files.  The best way to protect your data is to have your access and account separate from other users.  Only one (1) account per person.<br><br></li>
  <li><b>Follow corporate policies and contractual obligations for handling and storing work-related information.</b><br>If you use your computer for work-related purposes, make sure to follow any corporate policies for handling and storing the information.  Our policies have been created and are frequently updated to protect proprietary information and customer data.<br><br></li>
  <li><b>Dispose of sensitive information properly.</b><br>Simply deleting a file does not completely erase it. To ensure that an attacker cannot access these files, make sure that you adequately erase sensitive files.<br><br></li>
