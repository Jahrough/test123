<big><b>Thirty-Five Million
Records Added to People at Work!</b></big><br>

&nbsp;<br>
We have improved our People at Work database with the addition of 35
million records.&nbsp; With monthly updates, our People at Work search will
give you the ability to locate more subjects where they may work. The
People at Work search includes business owners, officers and directors,
possible employees, government employees and more!&nbsp; A confidence level
is included in the search results, indicating how confident we are of
the link.&nbsp; Look for the green/yellow/red thermometer icon on the
right-hand side of the search results.<br>
<br>
The People at Work search is located in the People section of the Main
Menu.&nbsp; Try it out and let us know what you think!<br>

<big><b>New Civil Court Records!</b></big> <br>
<br>
We have added an additional Civil Court county to our Civil Court
Search.&nbsp; In addition to those already online, you can now search Civil
Court records for Greene County, Ohio.
