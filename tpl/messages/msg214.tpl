<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Using comprehensive public record data to search 
for suspicious activity and fraudulent identity manipulation, Chargeback 
Defender&reg; accurately identifies high-risk card-not-present credit card 
transactions, and distills the results into a single, easy-to-understand risk 
score. <BR>Credit card fraud costs banks and financial institutions around $1 
billion each year.&nbsp; Chargeback Defender&reg; resolves address verification 
(AVS) failures in order to distinguish profitable sales opportunities from 
potential stolen credit card transactions. This solution evaluates high-risk 
patterns found during address and identity verification, and summarizes all 
results in order to help retailers best evaluate the risk of a given 
transaction.</FONT></DIV>
