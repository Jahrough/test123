<b>FIVE MILLION RECORDS ADDED
TO PHONES PLUS!</b><br>
<br>
Phones Plus has been enhanced with even more data!&nbsp; <b>Five million
records</b> have been added to the Phones Plus database. With over 100
million cell and alternative phone numbers not currently found in
Electronic Directory Assistance, Phones Plus provides the best option
to find otherwise difficult to locate subjects.<br>

<br>
<small>Information available through the Phones Plus feature may not be
used for marketing solicitation or similar purpose. Service contains
cell phone numbers. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 U.S.C sec
227) prohibits uses of automatic telephone dialing systems to make any
call to any cellular telephone service or any other service for which
the called party is charged for the call.</small><br>
