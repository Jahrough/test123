available in People at Work and Phones
Plus</FONT></STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>LexisNexis&reg; Link ID&#8482; is an advanced data
linking and analysis technology that is the power behind your LexisNexis
information solution. It connects the breadth and depth of LexisNexis data
sources to bring you relevant, insightful information, so you can make timely
and accurate decisions.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>You can now search on an individual&#8217;s Link
ID number, a unique, 12-digit identifier that does not contain any personally
identifiable information such as a Social Security number (SSN) in order to link
and connect data, giving you the maximum degree of protection and data
security.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Link ID is often also a better indicator of a unique
individual than an SSN because a Link ID number only pulls records associated
with a single person. In addition, Link ID is able to link multiple variations
of an individual&#8217;s name (e.g., nicknames, misspellings and maiden names)&#8212;even in
cases where an SSN may not be available.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>How It
Works:</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>An individual&#8217;s unique Link ID number is already
available in the results of a Deep Skip Search and will now be returned in
People at Work and Phones Plus searches as well. You can then click on the Link
ID number to initiate a new Deep Skip, People at Work or Phones Plus Search
where you will gain:</FONT></DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>
