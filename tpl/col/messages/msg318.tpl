    As a valued customer, we appreciate your business and strive to bring you the best data and products available in the marketplace.  Due to a recent change by one of our vendors, the MVR Driving Reports are no longer available in Accurint.  We are diligently looking for another vendor who will allow us to provide you with the quality product you have come to expect from LexisNexis.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions, please contact LexisNexis&reg; Customer Support at 866.277.8407 or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com" target="_blank"><u><b>Email Us.</b></u></a>
