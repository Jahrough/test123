    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Due to a security vulnerability called "Poodle", as of December 7th, some users with outdated versions of certain web browsers may not be able to access the LexisNexis solutions.  The most commonly impacted software is Internet Explorer version 6.
    <br><br>
    To ensure that you maintain uninterrupted access to your LexisNexis solutions, we are encouraging all users to work with their network administrators or IT organizations to upgrade their Internet Explorer web browser software to the most current version.  Alternatively, current web browsers from other vendors, such as FireFox, Mozilla or Chrome can be used to access your LexisNexis Solutions.
    <br><br>
    As information, this vulnerability may permit the decryption by third parties of encrypted information transmitted between browsers and servers that use an obsolete cryptographic protocol (SSL version 3) to communicate, instead of the newer TLS protocol.  In order to further enhance the protection against this vulnerability, on December 7th, LexisNexis will disable Secure Socket Layer (SSL v.3), and require Transport Layer Service (TLS) for our products.

    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Based on customer feedback, an autocomplete feature has been added for the City and Zip Code fields in the search form.  This feature improves user efficiency by requiring fewer keystrokes to perform a search.  As the first three characters are entered in the City field, the system will query and show a list of "City and State" that matches the input.  Zip Code will list "Zip, City and State."  The top five matching records will be returned within the autocomplete selection menu for City and Zip Code data input.
    <br><br>
    This feature can be disabled at an account level by a System Administrator under Manage Company.  In addition, Users can disable the feature under Preferences.
