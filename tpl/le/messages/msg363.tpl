    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Accurint now supports <b>IPv6,</b> which is short for "Internet Protocol Version 6."  This is the Internet's next-generation protocol, designed to replace the current Internet Protocol, IP Version 4. Everyone with a web presence is in the process of slowly transitioning to the newer conventions, which will change some of the most fundamental aspects of web communications - such as IP addresses.
    <br><br>
    Accurint will continue to support IPv4. If you wish to use IPv6, you may do so by simply accessing a new URL for Accurint. The IPv6-only address for Accurint is https://secureIPv6.accurint.com. The IPv4 address will continue to be https://secure.accurint.com.
    <br><br>
    IPv4 and IPv6 will coexist with one another for years. LexisNexis has planned to enable IPv6 support within the existing IPv4 URL https://secure.accurint.com in the future, while continuing to support the new IPv6 only URL: <a href="https://secureIPv6.accurint.com" target="_blank"><b><u>https://secureIPv6.accurint.com</u></b></a>.
    <br><br>
    What is IPv6 and Why Do We Need It?
    <br><br>
    In order to communicate over the Internet, computers and other devices must have sender and receiver addresses. These numeric addresses are known as Internet Protocol addresses. As the Internet and the number of people using it grows exponentially, so does the need for IP addresses.  IPv6 is a standard developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an organization that develops Internet technologies. The IETF, anticipating the need for more IP addresses, created IPv6 to accommodate the growing number of users and devices accessing the Internet.
    <br><br>
    IPv6 allows more users and devices to communicate on the Internet by using bigger numbers to create IP addresses. Under IPv4, every IP address is 32 bits long, which allows 4.3 billion unique addresses.  An example IPv4 address is 172.16.254.1. In comparison, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits, which allow for approximately three hundred and forty trillion, trillion unique IP addresses. An example IPv6 address is 2001:db8:ffff:1:201:02ff:fe03:0405.
    <br><br>
    IPv6 offers other networking advantages. In most cases, computers and applications will detect and take advantage of IPv6-enabled networks and services without requiring any action from the user.  IPv6 also relieves other networking issues that can arise due to the limited number of addresses available on IPv4.  For example, IPv6 reduces the need for Network Address Translation, a service that allows multiple clients to share a single IP address, but is not always reliable.
