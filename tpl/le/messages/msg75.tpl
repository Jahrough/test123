    <b>New Relavint Features!!!</b>
    <ul><b>You can now Print, Copy and Save your Relavint Charts!</b><br><br>
    <b>Print.</b></br><br>
    We have added the ability to print your visual link analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply select the browser's Print option from the File Menu, change the orientation to landscape, and print the graphical picture that is in the viewable window.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that only the portion of the diagram visible in the window will be printed.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your diagram doesn't fit in the viewable window, try zooming out or using the copy feature to print your entire diagram from another application.<br><br>
    <b>Copy.</b><br><br>
    If your graphical picture is too large to fit within the viewable space, you can optionally copy the image to the clipboard and use any program to paste the contents.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you copy the image to Excel you can print directly from Excel onto a larger paper to fit the image -- or allow Excel to break your picture into multiple pages.<br><br>
    <b>Save.</b><br><br>
    If you simply want to store your image on your hard drive or other media, you can now choose from numerous output types and save the image by clicking on the save button in the "control" section of the window.
