accommodated my agency&#8217;s request for personalized training by providing expert 
insight regarding their product and specific ways how our personnel could 
utilize these services to maximize our use and efficiency.&nbsp; The training 
staff was exceptionally professional and answered our employee&#8217;s questions, 
while illustrating a variety of applications that expanded our employee&#8217;s 
knowledge and skills.&nbsp; The relaxed atmosphere encouraged interaction, 
resulting in excitement and encouragement of our employee&#8217;s to increase their 
productivity with their training based skills.&nbsp; I would highly recommend 
this training program and opportunity to all agencies.&#8221;</EM>&nbsp; - Brad
