    <br><br>
    LexisNexis launched the Real-Time Phones Search* capability within Accurint<sup>&reg;</sup> back in September 2009.  Based on customer feedback and new functionality offerings, we are excited to announce that this search has been further enhanced to include additional data returns, flexibility in searching by names, and the ability to order additional reports.
    <br><br>
    The Real-Time Phones Search now allows users to:
    <ul>
      <li>Search similar sounding names for an individual allowing for the flexibility to locate matches when a last name may be misspelled;
      <li>Receive deceased indicator and date of death information; and
      <li>Order a variety of reports such as the Phone Detail Report, Comprehensive Reports, and Finder Reports.
    </ul>
    For more information regarding the enhanced Real-Time Phones Search available on the Main Menu under the Phones section, please contact your account representative with any questions.
    <br><br>
    <small>* The Real-Time Phones Search which is available through Accurint is an Add-On feature and will be priced accordingly.  Please contact your account representative for more information.</small>
