within Accurint&reg; for Law Enforcement</STRONG></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG><FONT size=3>New and Improved User 
Interface, Enhanced Functionality, and Additional Content and Searches Now 
Available</FONT></STRONG><BR></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Welcome to the New Version of Accurint&reg; for Law 
Enforcement!&nbsp; We updated the look-and-feel of the Main Menu, search tabs, 
and results pages.&nbsp; A &#8220;Classic View&#8221; link will display in the navigation 
toolbar so you can return to the classic look-and-feel at any time.&nbsp; The 
fresh user interface, modern layout, and new features and functionality will 
only be accessible within the New Accurint.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The New Version of 
Accurint enables your online experience to be streamlined and more efficient 
than ever before.&nbsp; Experience how the navigation is simplified between 
searches with <STRONG>My Accurint.</STRONG>&nbsp; The new &#8220;My Accurint&#8221; tool 
will allow you to customize a tab with your favorite searches.</FONT></DIV>

  provide you with enhanced mapping functionality.</FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT size=2 face=Arial><STRONG>Case Deconfliction tools, powered by 
  Accurint&reg; Case Connect</STRONG>, will auto-notify two or more Users that have 
  searched on the same record, either inter-agency or intra-agency, including 
  other external Law Enforcement and/or Government Users (as allowed by your 
  Administrator) to agree to connect to discuss case similarities.&nbsp; This 
  tool can improve case investigations and workflow efficiencies by the 
  cross-referencing of two agents&#8217; searches so that they may decide to share 
  case notes and improve officer safety by collaborating on their 
  investigations.</FONT></LI>

  allowing a report to be ordered without searching first, when the subject&#8217;s

  enhanced with addition of a mapping feature, option to display offenders&#8217;

  affiliated address will now be returned and you can see the Offenses and 
  Scars/Marks/Tattoos information at-a-glance.</FONT></LI>
