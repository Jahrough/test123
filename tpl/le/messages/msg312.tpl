    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    The Sexual Offenders search has been enhanced with an additional input field for querying.&nbsp; The new Offenses field contains a drop-down list of categories to select from.&nbsp; This new field is optional and not required to conduct a search.&nbsp; The Sexual Offenders search Help page has been updated to include information on this new search field.
    <br><br>
    When the Offenses field is used, the search results will be sorted with the best-matching records at the top of the list.&nbsp; Using this new field can help you narrow down to particular persons of interest or offenses related to your investigation.&nbsp; The Offense description field is already displayed in search results, but now you can search by this information as well.
    <br><br>
    The enhancement is included in all price plans and is enabled at no additional cost to your agency.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions regarding the newest enhancement, please contact your LexisNexis Account Representative or Customer Support at 866.277.8407 or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com" target="_blank"><b><u>Email Us</u></b></a>.
