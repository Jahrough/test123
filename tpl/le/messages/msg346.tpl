    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    The latest enhancements are designed to make LexisNexis Accurint for Law Enforcement an even more powerful tool for investigations, offering additional information on your subject.
    <br><br>
    <b>The new Accurint interface will provide you:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Images on file for Criminal Records and Arrest Logs for <b>Criminal Records Search</b> results.
      <li><b>Phone search consolidation</b> with Real-Time Phones and Canadian Phones being the primary search offerings.
      <li><b>Offender images</b> (e.g., Sexual Offender and Arrest Log photos) will display in the Word and PDF formats of the <b>Comprehensive Report and Custom Comprehensive Report.</b>
      <li><b>Restyled reports</b> that provide a consistent look-and-feel throughout Accurint.&nbsp; Updated sample reports are available within the product and reflect the restyled reports.
      <li>A new <b>Print</b> option in search results that support printing only record(s) of interest.
    </ul>
    The above enhancements are included in all price plans and are enabled at no additional cost to your agency.
    <br><br>
    <b>Please note:</b>&nbsp; The Phones Plus, Basic Lookup, and Reverse Lookup searches will no longer be available.&nbsp; The Real-Time Phones search will be the default phones search moving forward.
    <br><br>
    LexisNexis Risk Solutions will continue to operate the service under your current agreement.
    <br><br>
