    Based on customer feedback, additional enhancements were made in <b>My Account:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Add/ Update/Copy User screens:</b>&nbsp; The Title field was re-labeled to Position Title; a new optional Name Prefix field was added; required fields are now denoted with bold type; clarifying verbiage was added to the message that displays when a System Administrator attempts to add a LoginID that already exists in the system.<br><br>
      <li><b>Activity tab:</b>&nbsp; A message was added to the screen that states "No activity was found." when there are no transactions for the end User within the selected time period.<br><br>
      <li><b>Manage Users screen:</b>&nbsp; System Administrators on a parent account now have the ability to search for users across all bill groups/accounts via a new drop-down field.
    </ul>
    The above enhancements are included in all price plans and are enabled at no additional cost.
    <br><br>
