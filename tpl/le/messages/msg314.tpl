    LexisNexis&reg; Risk Solutions is pleased to announce the launch of a new addition to the e-learning program, LexisNexis University School of Law Enforcement.&nbsp; The first degree program, Bachelor of Accurint for Law Enforcement, was launched on September 29, 2011.&nbsp; The second degree program, <b>Master of Accurint for Law Enforcement</b>, is now available!  This degree program is an intermediate course into the use of public records for law enforcement purposes.&nbsp; Our advanced, desktop public records solution, Accurint&reg; LE Plus, will be explored and demonstrated.
    <br><br>
    The School of Law Enforcement is intended to allow Accurint for Law Enforcement and Accurint LE Plus users to become more proficient in their use of the Accurint solution.&nbsp; The training is available 24/7 and is available to you at no additional charge.

    You may access the University via the <b>LexisNexis Investigators Network</b>.&nbsp; After you sign on to Accurint, click on the LexisNexis Investigators Network banner located either on the search page or Main Menu.&nbsp; You will then be re-directed via a separate browser window to the LexisNexis Investigators Network site.&nbsp; Once within that site, look for the <b>LexisNexis University</b> banner on the homepage and under the Events and Training section of the site.
