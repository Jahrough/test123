Phones* Batch Now Available</STRONG></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>LexisNexis launched Real-Time Phones Search 
capability within Accurint&reg; back in September 2009 and added the ability to 
process large amounts of records using Real-Time Phones via batch early this 
year. As we have continued to enhance the standalone search throughout the year, 
we are pleased to announce that these enhancements including Link IDTM, Social 
Security Number, and address only searching are now available in Accurint&reg; 
Real-Time Phones Batch.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Accurint Real-Time Phones Batch functionality is 
located within the new &#8220;Online Batch Menu Page&#8221;.&nbsp; As a user, you can now 
select the batch menu and run multiple Real-Time Phones searches at once 
(through a delivery method called Online Batch) in a matter of seconds or 
minutes by walking through the easy-to-use batch steps.&nbsp; Accurint Real-Time 
Phones Batch allows you to run the same search on massive amounts of data at one 
time.&nbsp; This can help your agency determine subjects&#8217; names and locations 
based on phone number and address queries, including a phone type, phone status, 
phone carrier details and porting information to allow for a contact to be made 
with operating companies for case investigations, including issuing subpoenas 
when necessary.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>

Phones Batch enhancement found within the Online Batch Menu, please contact your
