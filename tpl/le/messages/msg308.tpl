    Driver License Data has been added to Advanced Person Search to give you and your agency the ability to search by another option.&nbsp; In return, you will get additional identifiers in the results of your subject of interest, and it will reduce the overall time involved in determining the driver license(s) of an individual, all at no additional cost.
