<font face="Arial" size="-1">
<br><br>
LexisNexis launched the Real-Time Phones Search capability within
Accurint&reg; back in September 2009.&nbsp; Based on customer feedback and new
functionality offerings, we are excited to announce that this search
has been enhanced to include new search types and additional data
returns.<br>
<br>
The Real-Time Phones Search now allows users to search by a subject's
name and social security number, get reported dates back within the
search results page, and have previous carrier data and historical data
associated with the phone number returned within the Phone Detail
Report. This service can help your agency determine subjects' names and
locations based on a phone number, address, and, <b>now available</b>,
subject name and social security number queries. The Phone Detail
Report will continue to include current phone type, phone status,
carrier details, and porting information and will now also return
previous phone type, carrier and contact detail as well as summary of
possible historical phone record information to give users a more
comprehensive overview of the phone number for case investigations,
including further detail that may be used in issuing subpoenas when
necessary.<br>
<br>
For more information regarding the enhanced Real-Time Phones Search,
available on the Main Menu under the Phones section, please contact
your account representative.<br>
<br>
<small>* The Real-Time Phones Search which is available through
Accurint is an add-on feature and will be priced accordingly.&nbsp; Please
contact your account representative for more information.<br>
