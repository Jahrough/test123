    <font face="verdana" size="-1">
    <br><br>
LexisNexis launched the Real-Time Phones Search capability within Accurint<sup>&reg;</sup> back in September 2009.  Based on customer feedback and new functionality offerings, we are excited to announce that this search has been further enhanced to include new search types and additional data returns. 
    <br><br>
The Real-Time Phones Search now allows users to search by an individual's Link ID<sup>TM</sup> number, a unique, 12-digit identifier which is created using the advanced data linking and analysis technology that is the power behind your LexisNexis information solution. You can click on an individual's Link ID number to initiate a new search for more precise and current results.
    <br><br>
The ability to search on an individual's unique Link ID number is also available in several additional searches, including the Advanced Person, People at Work, Phones Plus, Bankruptcy, Liens & Judgments, Drivers License, Death, and Marriage &amp; Divorce Searches.  
    <br><br>
Link ID will also be added to the Phone Detail Report within the Possible Historical Records section and offer the users the opportunity to show other possible connections related to the phone number for case investigation purposes, including further detail that may be used in issuing subpoenas when necessary. 
    <br><br>
Completely free of sensitive personally identifying information, a Link ID number is only associated with a single individual, whereas a Social Security number can sometimes be associated with multiple people or a single person can be associated with multiple SSNs. In addition, the Link ID number is able to link multiple variations of an individual's name -- such as nicknames, misspellings and maiden names -- even in cases where an SSN may not be available. 
    <br><br>
For more information regarding the enhanced Real-Time Phones Search available on the Main Menu under the Phones section, please contact your account representative with any questions. 
    <br><br>
* The Real-Time Phones Search which is available through Accurint is an add-on feature and will be priced accordingly.  Please contact your account representative for more information.
