    LexisNexis<sup>&reg;</sup> Risk Solutions is pleased to announce the launch of a new e-learning program, LexisNexis University.&nbsp; The first curriculum, the School of Law Enforcement, is now available!  The training is available 24/7 and is available to you at no additional charge.
    <br><br>
    The School of Law Enforcement is intended to allow Accurint for Law Enforcement and Accurint LE Plus users to become more proficient in their use of the Accurint solution by completing and passing three successive degree programs:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bachelor of Accurint for Law Enforcement;</b></li>
      <li><b>Master of Accurint for Law Enforcement; and</b></li>
      <li><b>Doctorate of Accurint for Law Enforcement.</b></li>
    </ul>
    In addition, system administrators can participate in a dedicated degree program -- <b>Bachelor of Accurint Account Administration.</b>
    <br><br>
    You may access the University via the <b>LexisNexis Investigators Network.</b>&nbsp; After you sign on to Accurint, click on the LexisNexis Investigators Network banner located either on the search page or Main Menu.&nbsp; You will then be re-directed via a separate browser window to the LexisNexis Investigators Network site.&nbsp; Once within that site, look for the <b>LexisNexis University</b> banner on the homepage and under the Events and Training section of the site.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions regarding this new feature, please contact your LexisNexis Account Representative or call Customer Support at 1-866-277-8407.
