<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>LexisNexis is committed to promoting the 
responsible use of information and protecting individual privacy rights. In 
recognition of this commitment, LexisNexis continually enhances its information 
security program.&nbsp;&nbsp; To that end, effective June 18th, 2009, customers 
with access to full Social Security Numbers (&#8220;SSNs&#8221;) and driver&#8217;s license 
numbers (&#8220;DLNs&#8221;) will see partially masked SSNs and DLNs for individuals found 
within a report but who were not the originally intended subject of the 
report.&nbsp; The SSN and DLN for the subject of the report will remain 
un-truncated in the report.&nbsp; In addition, there will be no changes for 
customers with Partial or Restricted access.</FONT></DIV>

security measure, please contact your Account Representative or our Customer
