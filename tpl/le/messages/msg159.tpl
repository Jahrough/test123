<b>The PATRIOT Act search has
been improved!</b><br>
<br>
A new search process (an adjustable fuzzy logic search) will provide:<br>
<br>

&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Flexible name matching to reduce false positive hits <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Parts of names are weighted in order to provide more accurate name
matching <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consideration of a sanctioned country being an exclusionary factor
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Results display with highest matching score(s) first thus
providing a quick assessment of false/positive results <br>

&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Customer controlled threshold levels which can be set per your
business requirements <br>
<br>
<b>Phones Plus is available through batch processing!</b><br>
<br>
When traditional phone sources are not enough&#8230;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Phones Plus provides an alternative search to track down phone numbers
not typically available to help locate hard-to-find subjects. Phones
Plus data is now available through batch processing.&nbsp; You can access
Phones Plus as a stand-alone process or through the Progressive Phones
search for your large-volume processing needs.<br>
<br>

<b>More Arrest Logs and County Court Records added to our Criminal
Records Search!</b> <br>
<br>
We have added three additional arrest logs and one additional county
court to our Criminal Records Search.&nbsp; In addition to those already
online, you can now search arrest logs for Benton County, Arkansas;
Hillsborough County, Florida; and Chatham County, Georgia.&nbsp; Criminal
court records have been added for Brazoria County, Texas.
