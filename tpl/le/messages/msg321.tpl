    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    The LexisNexis Investigators Network (LNIN) was upgraded and re-launched with many changes and added functionality to help you connect with other investigators.&nbsp; The next time you log in, you will see many improvements to the site.&nbsp; One of the biggest changes you will see is the new Home page for the Network.&nbsp; LNIN now allows you to see the most popular discussions, most recent posts and any discussions that you are following.&nbsp; This also gives you a quick glimpse into recent activity by other members within the Network.
    <br><br>
    In addition to the new Home page, Groups and Discussions are combined into one new section.&nbsp; This new section has all the same information as the previous areas, but is streamlined into one section.&nbsp; You are still be able to find, follow and comment on discussions and are still able to network with investigators and analysts with specific interests and expertise.
    <br><br>
    The Member Section of LNIN has also been upgraded to allow you to select your areas of Expertise and Interest.&nbsp; By completing this section of your member profile, you will be able to find other investigators that share the same interests and have certain expertise you may be looking for within the Network.
    <br><br>
    We hope you find these changes and upgrades to the LexisNexis Investigators Network helpful.&nbsp; If you experience any problems logging in or accessing LNIN, please email Mary Craige, Community Manager, at <a href="mailto:mary.craige@lexisnexis.com"><b><u>mary.craige@lexisnexis.com</u></b></a>.
