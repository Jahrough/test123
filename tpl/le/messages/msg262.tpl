<font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">
<br><br>
A couple months ago, we released Source Documents in the Person Search and Advanced Person Search functionality within Accurint&reg;. Today, we just added the Source Documents capability behind the Business Search functionality.  
<br><br>
LexisNexis knows that the credibility and details behind the sources that help generate the results within Accurint are very important to your agency.  We would like to announce a new Source Documents feature that will help provide you and your agency the credibility and background information behind the Business Search functionality.  By generating a list of sources, number of hits, and the timeframe of these sources within Accurint, you will be able to gauge the level of credibility you, as an agency, will want to assign to the results.  Based on the source information, you will also be in a better position to direct your investigations by making more informed decisions as it relates to following up on tips and leads. 
<br><br>
Now when you run a Business Search, you will be able to access the source document information pursuant to the initial business you ran the search on within Accurint.  This new display source information is on individual pieces of data such as Name, Address and Phone Number in your search results with the number of times each record appeared or helped generate results.  Upon receiving the results from each search, you will have the option to view which specific sources were used to compile the search results, how many instances of a particular source was used to generate the result, and when the specific data first and last appeared within the source.
