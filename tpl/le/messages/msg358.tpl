    Situational awareness is important for the safety of personnel in the field, and having up-to-date information about an address can alert law enforcement to changes in a location.
    <br><br>
    LexisNexis&reg; Accurint for Law Enforcement is adding a new feature to help your agency give personnel advanced information prior to responding to a location, whether it is for an investigation, canvass, response to a 911 call, execution of a warrant, health care visit, parolee visit etc.
    <br><br>
    The Law Enforcement Location Report* will include the following information about an address:
    <table width="600">
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td width="288">
	<ul>
	  <li>The owner of the address</li>
	  <li>All occupants</li>
	  <li>Immediate neighbors</li>
	  <li>Relatives and Associates</li>
	  <li>Criminal Filings</li>
	  <li>Sex Offenses</li>
	</ul>
	</td>
	<td width="312">
	<ul>
	  <li>Phone Numbers</li>
	  <li>Businesses</li>
