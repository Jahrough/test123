    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    The Real-Time Phones search can help you locate hard-to-find individuals by running simple queries using phone number, address, and other queries based on subject data such as name and Social Security number.&nbsp; Based on customer feedback and new functionality offerings, we are excited to announce that this search has been further enhanced to include additional display flags, supplementary data, and more!
    <br><br>
    The enhancement details include the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Search results now display multiple flags for all possible High Risk Address indicators.
      <li>Descriptive text now appears for report icons in search results.
      <li>To make the Phone Detail Report cleaner and easier to read, fields that do not contain information on the phone number will no longer be returned in the Real-Time Phone Detail section.
      <li>A supplementary data source has been added to improve search results and expand coverage of available phone information.
    </ul>
    *The Real-Time Phones Search, which is available through Accurint, is an add-on feature and will be priced accordingly.&nbsp; If you have any questions regarding these enhancements, please contact your LexisNexis Account Representative or Customer Support at 866.277.8407 or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com/" target="_blank"><b><u>Email Us</u></b></a>.
