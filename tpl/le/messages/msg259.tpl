Available</STRONG></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>LexisNexis recently launched a new Real-Time Phones 
Search capability within Accurint&reg; back in September 2009.&nbsp; Based on 
customer feedback, we are excited to announce that this same search is now made 
available through our new &#8220;Online Batch&#8221; tool within the system.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Real-Time Phones Batch functionality is located 
within the new &#8220;Online Batch Menu Page&#8221;.&nbsp; As a user, you can now select the 
batch menu and run multiple Real-Time Phones searches at once (<EM>through a 
delivery method called Online Batch</EM>) in a matter of seconds or minutes by 
walking through the easy-to-use batch steps.&nbsp; The Real-Time Phones Batch 
allows you to run the same search on massive amounts of data at one time.&nbsp; 
This can help your agency determine subjects&#8217; names and locations based on phone 
number and address queries, including a phone type, phone status, phone carrier 
details and porting information to allow for a contact to be made with operating 
companies for case investigations, including issuing subpoenas when 
necessary.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>For more information regarding the new Real-Time 
Phones Batch enhancement found within the Online Batch Menu, please contact your 
account representative with any questions regarding this new addition to 
Accurint.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>* The Real-Time Phones Batch which is now available 
through Accurint is an add-on feature and will be priced accordingly.&nbsp; 
Please contact your account representative for more information.</FONT></DIV>
