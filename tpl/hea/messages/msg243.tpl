<DIV>LexisNexis carefully protects the information contained in our 
databases.&nbsp; In order to further safeguard that information, we have 
recently changed the permissible use display that is presented to users before 
they are permitted to perform any searches in a public records source. 
Availability to public record sources is regulated by federal, state and local 
governments. Effective August 06, 2009 only the permissible uses certified to by 
your company in its contract with LexisNexis will be displayed and available for 
selection.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Two permissible use screens will continue to be displayed after you have 
selected your public records source and prior to the execution of your 
search.&nbsp; Complete both screens to select your valid permissible use and 
your search results will then be returned.&nbsp; If you have any questions or 
concerns about what permissible use to choose you should contact your company&#8217;s 
System Administrator.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After you have selected your permissible uses, these selections will 
persist throughout your research session.&nbsp; If you no longer have a 
permissible use, or the applicable permissible use changes, you select the 
appropriate permissible uses.&nbsp; To change your permissible uses, select the 
hyperlinked permissible use located at the bottom of the search screen.&nbsp; 
You will be taken back to the two GLBA and DPPA permissible use screens, where 
you can revise your selections and continue with your search.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>LexisNexis is pleased to offer comprehensive public records data that is 
well protected, and we appreciate your understanding of the importance of data 
security.&nbsp; Please contact your Account Representative directly or Customer 
Support at 1-866-277-8407 with any questions or concerns.</DIV>
