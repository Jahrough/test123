<br><br>
LexisNexis carefully protects the personal information contained in our public records databases.&nbsp; In order to further safeguard that information, we have recently changed the permissible use display that is presented prior to searching any public records source.&nbsp; Effective July 9, 2009 only the permissible uses set fourth in your company's contract will be displayed and available for selection.
<br><br>
In order to ensure public records are being accessed in compliance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), and various state laws, you will now be required to indicate a GLBA and DPPA permissible purpose, or to affirmatively indicate that you have no permissible purpose, before you run any public records search.  
<br><br>
Two permissible use screens will display after you have selected your public records source and prior to the execution of your search.&nbsp; Simply complete both screens to select your permissible use and your search results will then be returned.  
<br><br>
After you have selected your permissible uses, these selections will persist throughout your research session unless you proactively decide to change them.&nbsp; To change your permissible uses, select the hyperlinked permissible use located at the bottom of the search screen.&nbsp; You will be taken back to the two GLBA and DPPA permissible use screens, where you can revise your selections and continue with your search.
<br><br>
LexisNexis is pleased to offer comprehensive public records data that is well protected, and we appreciate your understanding of the importance of data security.&nbsp; Please contact your Account Representative directly, or Customer Support at 1-800-543-6862, with any questions or concerns.
