<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The InstantID&reg; report available in Accurint for 
Health Care will now feature Red Flags Report capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
addition to receiving verification of the search subject and a score reflecting 
the strength of this verification, users will now also obtain a report in the 
search result displaying all categories indicating situations where identity 
verification could be compromised, or less accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples could 
include an input Social Security Number being associated with a separate 
name/address than the search subject or inability to verify an address or phone 
number.&nbsp;&nbsp; These categories, known as Red Flags Categories in the 
InstantID report, help users understand any potential issues associated with 
verifying the identity of their search subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; This additional 
confidence in understanding identity verification strength will also assist 
organizations striving to meet upcoming Federal Red Flags compliance 
guidelines.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Red Flags report information is now automatically 
included with the base InstantID report at a total cost of 75 cents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

plan.<BR>&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
