    <center><b>WELCOME TO ACCURINT FOR COLLECTIONS!!</b></center>
    <br><br>
    This new product has features designed specifically for the collection community.&nbsp;&nbsp;You get information you need in seconds with new capabilities designed just for you.
    <br><br>
    <b>New Person Search Results!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have changed the way the results are returned on the Person Search to better help you find the person you are looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a given address, we will now show you all name variations for an individual at that address, multiple phone numbers (both verified and non-verified), and all dates of birth reported for the individual at that address.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know you will be pleased with the new results.
    <br><br>
    <b>New Business Collections Batch!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have designed a new batch specifically to assist you in collecting debts for businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new Business Collectors batch will return information on whether the company you've specified is defunct or has filed for bankruptcy, and if you supply the name of a principal of the company, whether that principal of the company is deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll also append up to five phone numbers and/or addresses for the company.
    <br><br>
    <b>Additional Court Records!</b>
    <br><br>
    We have added an additional State to our Criminal Records Search.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to those already online, you can now search criminal court records in the State of Georgia.
