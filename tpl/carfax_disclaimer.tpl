IN NO EVENT WILL CARFAX or LN BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF TIME, LOSS OF PROFITS OR INCOME, OR ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR DEMAND) EVEN IF CARFAX AND LN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

4. Customer agrees to indemnify and hold CARFAX and LN and their agents harmless from any claims, suits or damages, either direct or indirect, arising out of the Customer's use of VHS.
