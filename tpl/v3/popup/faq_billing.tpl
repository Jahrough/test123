<a name="1" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>1. How are Invoices and Statements sent?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
Invoices and Statements are sent via email from Accurint Billing
Statements (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:billing_statements@accurint.com">billing_statements@accurint.com</a>) on or about the first day
of each month. The Primary and Billing Contacts on your account will be
the only recipients. In addition, the System Administrator on your
account has the ability to retrieve Invoices and Statements directly
from our website by going to &#8220;My Account,&#8221; &#8220;Billing Info.&#8221; From the
Billing Summary, you may download Invoices, Statements, and activity
going back 90 days. You can also make Online Payments and view your
payment history.<br>
<br>
Make sure the email addresses you have on file with Accurint are
current and correct. Changes to your email address or changes in
contact personnel must be reported to Accurint Customer Accounting so that
we may update your company information. Incorrect information will
prevent you from receiving your Invoices and Statements.<br>
<br>
<a name="2" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>2. How do I view my Invoices and Statements?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
To view Invoices and Statements, you will need a current version of
Adobe Acrobat Reader which is available as a free download at

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html</a>. This will enable
you to view and print Invoices and Statements that are emailed to you.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> Customers with Internet firewalls, SPAM Detectors, email
content filtering, pop-up blockers, and other security measures will
prevent Accurint&#8217;s Invoices from reaching your contact personnel. Alert
your Network Administrator or IT Department to allow email from the
domain Accurint.com. You will need to allow for embedded links in
emails from the Accurint.com domain. Computers and browsers must be
configured correctly.<br>
<br>
<a name="3" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>3. What if I misplace my Invoice or Statement?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
Invoices and Statements are available for download by your System
Administrator directly from our website. Go to &#8220;My Account, Billing
Info.&#8221; You may also contact our Customer Accounting Department directly by
emailing us at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:billing_statements@accurint.com">billing_statements@accurint.com</a> or by calling us at 1-888-332-8244, and request that we email you a copy of your Invoice. Please have your Accurint account number available when making inquiries or requests.<br>

<br>
<a name="4" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>4. Why are there different amounts on my Invoice and Statement?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
Your Invoice reflects only new charges incurred during any given month.
Your Statement will reflect ALL activity that occurred during the month
(i.e., a previous unpaid balance, payments and credits, and the current
monthly charges). Your Invoice and Statement will also show your
payment terms and due date.<br>
<br>
<a name="5" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>5. Why am I not getting my Invoice each month?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
Invoices and Statements are emailed to your company&#8217;s Primary and
Billing Contacts. Any changes to your company&#8217;s address, phone number,
email addresses, or contact personnel must be updated and kept current
with Accurint.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> Customers with Internet firewalls, SPAM Detectors, email
content filtering, pop-up blockers, and other security measures will
prevent Accurint&#8217;s Invoices from reaching your contact personnel. Alert
your Network Administrator or IT Department to allow email from the
domain Accurint.com. You will need to allow for embedded links in
emails from the Accurint.com domain. Computers and browsers must be
configured correctly.<br>

<br>
<a name="6" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>6. What are my payment terms?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
Your payment terms and due date can be found on both your Invoice and
Statement directly below your company name and address.<br>
<br>
<a name="7" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>7. How can I make a payment on my account?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
Accurint accepts payment in the form of Check or Credit Card (VISA,
MasterCard, and American Express). You can make payments via the
following methods:<br>
<ul>
  <li>U.S. Mail (check payment only)</li>
  <li>Online through the Accurint website</li>
  <li>Call Accurint Customer Accounting Department<br>
  </li>

</ul>
If you send your check by mail, please and remit to:<br>
<blockquote>
Accurint<br>
LexisNexis<br>
Attn: Accounts Receivable<br>
P.O. Box 7247-6157<br>
Philadelphia, PA 19170-6157<br>
</blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Please reference your Accurint account number on all checks.<br>

<br>
You may Pay Online by Check or Credit Card. Your System Administrator
is authorized to go to the &#8220;My Account&#8221; section of the Accurint
website. Click on the blue link &#8220;Make Online Payments&#8221; and follow the
instructions for paying either by Check or Credit Card. For credit card
accounts registered online, the zip code entered must match the zip
code on your credit card statement. Payments made online take one
business day to post to your account.<br>
<br>
The most simple and hassle-free option allows you to have your Accurint
charges automatically bill to your credit card each month. You will
need to update credit card expiration dates and new card numbers as
needed. You will still receive your monthly Invoice detailing your
current charges. Your Statement will reflect your credit card payment
which will always be run on the last day of each month.<br>
<br>
You may contact Accurint Customer Accounting at 1-888-332-8244 to make payments by Credit Card, Check-by-Phone, or Wire
Transfer. Please have your Accurint account number available when you
call. Please note that we experience a high volume of calls on the 1st
and 21st day of every month. For quicker assistance, please contact us
via email at Accurint Customer Accounting (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:billing_statements@accurint.com">billing_statements@accurint.com</a>).<br>
<br>
<a name="8" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>8. How can I access Detailed Billing?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
Your System Administrator can download your detailed activity by
accessing the &#8220;My Account&#8221; section of the Accurint website, &#8220;Billing
Info.&#8221; Detailed activity may be obtained for the past 90 days by
clicking on &#8220;Download Activity&#8221; or &#8220;View Activity.&#8221; The detailed
activity shows searches performed during the calendar month by User
Login ID and will provide date and time of search (defaults to GMT
Greenwich Mean Time), the cost of the search, and the reference code
(if used).<br>

<br>
Your detailed activity will correspond with the Online charges billed
on your Invoice. To access a complete list, download &#8220;All Users.&#8221; Your
information will download into Excel format which can easily be sorted.<br>
<br>
<a name="9" style="padding-top:50px;"><b>9. What is a Dunning Notice? Why did I get one?</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top">Top</a><br>
Dunning Notices are sent to those customers with outstanding balances
as a reminder that payment is due according to the net terms previously
set forth with Accurint. Notices are sent automatically via email to
the Primary and Billing Contacts on your account. Questions regarding
your account can be submitted by replying to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:billing_statements@accurint.com">billing_statements@accurint.com</a> or by contacting
Accurint Customer Accounting at 1-888-332-8244.<br>
