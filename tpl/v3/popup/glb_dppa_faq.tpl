Federal law, in conjunction with your user agreement with LexisNexis&reg;, requires you to have a permissible use in order to view personal information. The applicable laws governing these uses are the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) and related state laws and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and Section 203 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, relating to the Death Master File (DMF). If you do not have a permissible use, you will not be given access to the personal information.

The Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), which became effective September 13, 1997, is a federal law enacted to regulate the release and sharing of personal information -- such as name, address, social security number, and driver license number -- assembled by Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs).
<br>
<br>
The list of permissible uses is shown on the "Permissible Use Certification for Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA)" page.
