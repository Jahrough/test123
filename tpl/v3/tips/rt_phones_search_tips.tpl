        <p><b>The Real-Time Phones Search allows you to locate the subject using a variety of search criteria such as the 10-digit phone number or subject name and address combinations.&nbsp; From the results of these queries, you can then request a Phone Detail Report to gather further information on the number, including phone type, line status, carrier information, and ported indicators, from the real-time sources.</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Find your subject using the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p><b>Search with Phone Numbers</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Accepted number of digits in this field is either 10 or seven.&nbsp; If not enough digits (six for example) or more than enough digits (11 for example) are entered, an error message will appear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; You can limit searches to include only residences, or only businesses, or both.</p>
