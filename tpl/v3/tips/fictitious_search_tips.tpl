	<TMPL_IF INS> <p><b>The Fictitious Business Names<TMPL_ELSE> <p><b>The Fictitious Business Name</TMPL_IF> search provides filings that reflect intent of an individual or company to conduct business under an FBN.  Information includes, when available, owner name, business name, file date and file number. Additionally, many counties provide the business address.</b></p>
	<p>&nbsp;<br>Find an FBN record using one or more of the following search techniques:<br>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>Search using a Filing Number, since this is a unique ten-digit number assigned to each document that is filed by a company to do business under another name, and will therefore be a very precise search term.<br><br></li>
	  <li>Search by Company Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City.<br><br></li>
	  <li>Search using a Phone Number (including Area Code).<br><br></li>
	  <li>Search using a Company's Address, City, and State. This can reveal other companies connected to the business.<br><br></li>
	  <li>Search by an individual's Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City.<br><br></li>
	</ol>
