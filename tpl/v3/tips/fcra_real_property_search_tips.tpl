	<h2><TMPL_VAR NAME="PAGE_TITLE"> Tips</h2>
	<p>For the best search coverage, we recommend searching both Property Deed and Property Assessment records by selecting All Real Property from the drop down list. Assessment records are typically added once a year while Deed records are added every time a deed transaction takes place. Therefore, both play a role as independent sources of information.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="font-style:oblique;">For optimal results, include Full Name &amp; Address &amp; SSN or Full Name &amp; Address DOB in your search terms.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Search results may only be viewed for a single subject. If insufficient criteria are utilized to narrow the search to your subject, a list of matches to your input will be displayed. Select the appropriate subject from the list to view the information.</p>
