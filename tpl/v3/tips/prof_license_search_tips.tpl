	<h2>Professional Licenses Search Tips</h2>
	<p><strong>The Professional Licenses search contains historical records for numerous professions (ex. Medical, Contractor) by state.  Available license types vary by state.</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Find a Professional License record using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ol id="font81">
		<li>Search by Name and State or Company Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. You can also use a partial first name.<br /><br /></li>
		<li>Search by Address, City, and State. <br /><br /></li>
		<li>Search by Social Security Number. <br /><br /></li>
		<li>Search by License Number, if known. (This will, however, return results for the specified License Number in any of the states for which we have coverage).<br /><br /></li>
	  </ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
