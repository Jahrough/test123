	<p><strong>Search for property information including Owner Name, Second Owner Name, Property Address, Owner Address, Seller Name, Land Usage, Sale Date, Recording Date, Tax Year, Sale Amount, Assessed Value, and Parcel Number.</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Find a Property Assessment record using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>Search by Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. You can also use a partial first name.<br />
          <br /></li>
	  <li>Search by Address, City, and State. This returns records for that address (where it is the Property Address) and any other properties using that address as the Owner's Address.<br/>
	  <br /></li>
	  </ol>

        <p>You can run a report that displays additional information, including: County, Subdivision Name, Year Built, Land Value, Improvement Value, Total Value, Tax Amount, Market Land Value, Market Improvement Value, Total Market Value, Assessed Year, Living Space (square feet), Land Size (square feet), Number of Stories, Foundation, Number of Bedrooms, Number of Full Baths, and Number of Half Baths.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>For the best search coverage, we recommend searching both Property Deed and Property Assessment records. Assessment records are typically added once a year while Deed records are added every time a deed transaction takes place. Therefore, both play a role as independent sources of information.</p>
