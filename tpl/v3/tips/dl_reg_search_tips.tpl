	<TMPL_IF INS>
	<p><strong>Search for data on registrants, owners and lien holders of a vehicle with this search and resulting Motor Vehicle Report option. Please click the "coverage" link under the SEARCH button for state to state coverage restrictions.</strong></p>
	<TMPL_ELSE>
	<p><strong>Search <TMPL_IF XBPS>Vehicle Investigations<TMPL_ELSE>Motor Vehicles</TMPL_IF> Records for general and activity information such as the driver's license number, drivers license state, drivers license status, violations, accidents, suspensions and other information normally found on the drivers license. Results vary by state.</strong></p>
	</TMPL_IF>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Search by Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. You can also use a partial first name.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Or search by Address, City, and State.  This returns records using that address.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>You can also perform a "wild card" search on a vehicle tag number. If you are unsure of the entire vehicle tag number or only have a partial tag number, you can use a wild card indicator (*) at the beginning or end of the tag number. For example, *123 will search for all vehicle tag numbers ending with 123, and 123* will search for all vehicle tag numbers beginning with 123. You can perform this search with or without identifying a state in your initial search criteria.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The search results are not limited to automobiles. Motor Vehicle records typically include boats, trailers, RVs, and other assets registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
