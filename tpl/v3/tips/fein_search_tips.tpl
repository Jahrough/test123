        <p><b>The Federal Employer ID Numbers (FEIN) search provides information that is collected by telephone queries conducted by the provider we license this data from -- which sample the business populace and gather information for complete business profiles.  FEIN records contain a wide range of information about businesses, including executive names and operating classifications.</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>Find an FEIN record using one or more of the following search techniques:<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol id="font81">
	  <li>Search using a Company's FEIN, since this is the unique, nine-digit federal employee identification number issued to each business by the IRS, and will therefore be a very precise search term.<br><br></li>
	  <li>Search by Company Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City.<br><br></li>
	  <li>Search using a Company's Address, City, and State. This can reveal other companies connected to the business.<br><br></li>
        </ol>
