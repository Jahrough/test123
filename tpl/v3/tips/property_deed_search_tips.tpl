	<p><strong>Search property information including Property Address, Owner Name, Seller Name, Owner Address, Sale Amount, Mortgage Amount, Sale Date, Recording Date, Parcel Number, Document Type, and Land Usage.</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Find a Property Assessment record using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>Search by Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. You can also use a partial first name.<br />
          <br /></li>
	  <li>Search by Address, City, and State. This returns records for that address (where it is the Property Address) and any other properties using that address as the Owner's Address.<br/>
	  <br /></li>
	  </ol>

	<p>You can run a report that displays additional information, including: County, Type, Loan Amount, Loan Terms, Transaction Type, Loan Type, Lender Name, and Title Company.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>For the best search coverage, we recommend searching both Property Deed and Property Assessment records. Assessment records are typically added once a year while Deed records are added every time a deed transaction takes place. Therefore, both play a role as independent sources of information.</p>
