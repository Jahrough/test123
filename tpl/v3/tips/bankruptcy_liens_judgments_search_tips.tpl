	<p>Locate the subject's bankruptcy records using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>

	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>If you know the subject's Social Security Number (SSN) or a company's Federal Tax ID Number (FEIN) use it alone in your first search. Even though SSN's are the most reliable identifier for an individual, they are not 100 percent dependable because some records may not contain a subject's SSN. Therefore, a record for an individual may not appear when searching using SSN only. Conducting a second search using Name and State provides additional coverage.<br /><br /></li>
	  <li>Search using Last Name, First Name, and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. You can also use a partial first name. Bankruptcy results may include Debtor Name, SSN, Address, Additional Debtor Name, SSN, Case Number, Date Filed, Court Location, and Filing Type.<br /><br /></li>
	</ol>
