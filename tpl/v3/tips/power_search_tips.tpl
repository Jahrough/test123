    <h2>Quick Search Tips</h2>
    <p class="tipsBlc"><strong>This is also referred to as the Natural Language Search, where a user types a key word (term) or a group of key
     words (phrase) in one text input area.
     The search returns records that contain all the key words. For example, if your input is “John Doe”, the system
     returns records that contain both words.</strong></p>
    <p class="tipsBlc">To start,</p>
    <ol id="font81">
      <li class="tipsBlc"> 
        Type the search term(s) in the <strong>Enter Terms</strong> field.
      </li>
      <li class="tipsBlc">
       <strong>Reference</strong> may be the case name or number. You can use numbers or characters, or
        a combination of both. This information is optional.
      </li>
      <li class="tipsBlc">
       Click the Search button.

    <h2>Terms & Connectors Search Tips</h2>
    <p class="tipsBlc"><strong>This is also known as Boolean Search. Basically it allows you to combine any words and phrases using operator words
      such as AND, OR, and NOT (otherwise known as Boolean operators) to limit, widen, or define your search.
      If you have very limited/fragmented information, the Terms &amp; Connectors Search can be of great help.</strong></p>
    <p class="tipsBlc">To start,</p>
    <ol id="font81">
      <li class="tipsBlc"> 
        Enter any information you may have in the search form, be it Name, SSN, Company, Address, City, State, Zip, DOB, or
         Phone, or a combination of these elements.
      </li>
      <li class="tipsBlc">
        In the <strong>Additional Terms</strong> area, enter anything else you think that is related to the subject entity.
         You can start with either terms or connectors. For example, you may enter &quot;international&quot; in the
         <strong>Company</strong> field; then add &quot;John Doe or Jane Doe&quot; in the <strong>Additional Terms</strong> area.
         Or enter &quot;John Doe&quot; in the <strong>Name</strong> field; then add &quot;or Jane Doe and Miami Florida&quot; in the
         <strong>Additional Terms</strong> area. 
      </li>
      <li class="tipsBlc">
       <strong>Reference</strong> may be the case name or number. You can use numbers or characters, or a combination
        of both. This is optional information.
