	<p>Keep in mind that you must enter information in at least one field. Searching by multiple fields increases your search precision, and therefore results in fewer documents that meet your exact criteria. To search more broadly, use fewer fields. When searching on common names, please complete as many fields as you can to avoid unduly large result sets.</p>
