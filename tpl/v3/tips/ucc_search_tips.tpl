	<p><strong>National UCC Filing records contain information from commercial lien filings. These records can help find assets used by businesses to secure commercial loans or to learn about financial relationships between individuals and businesses.</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Find a UCC record using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ol id="font81">
	<li>Search by Company Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City.<br />
          <br /></li>

	<li>Search using FEIN.<br />
          <br /></li>

	<li>Search using a Last Name, First Name and State. This will find UCC Filings where an individual is listed personally as a Debtor.<br />
          <br /></li>

	<li>Search using a Company's Address, City, and State. This can reveal other companies connected to the business. <br />
          <br /></li>

	<li>Conduct a Corporation Search to learn of other company names, and then conduct UCC searches using those names.<br />
          <br /></li>

	<li>Search using Original Filing Number. If too many records are returned, add the filing date range or filing jurisdiction to narrow your results.<br />
          <br /></li>
	  </ol>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can run a UCC report that displays additional information, including: Filing Number, Filing Type, Filing Date, Filing Agency, Filing Agency Address, Debtor, Creditor, Secured, and Assignee Party information, Expiration Date, Collateral, and detailed information related to the filing. If there are multiple Secured Parties or Debtor Parties, use the report to see that information.</p>
