    <b>Introducing SSN Flags!</b>
    <br><br>
    To assist in your identity verification and fraud investigation efforts, we are introducing our new SSN Flags feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;These flags help you distinguish between valid and potentially questionable SSNs for your subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using our depth of data and sophisticated algorithms, we identify for you whether the SSN on a record is valid, belongs to a relative of the subject, or is a partial or no-match that should be investigated further.
    <br><br>
    The new SSN Flags are available in the results of the Advanced Person Search at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!&nbsp;&nbsp;Try this new feature and let us know what you think.

    <b>New Sexual Offender States</b>

    We have added two additional states to our Sexual Offender search.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 47 states already online, you can now search for sexual offenders in California and Hawaii.
    <br><br>
    <b>Additional Liens/Judgment State</b>
    <br><br>
    We have added the state of Georgia to our Liens and Judgments search bringing our coverage of Liens and Judgments to 42 states.
    <br><br>
    <b>Additional Professional Licenses</b>
    <br><br>
    Our professional license database continues to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have added professional licenses in five additional states.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now search for licenses in Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Utah.
