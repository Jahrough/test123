MILLION</font> RECORDS ADDED TO PHONES PLUS!</b><br>
<br>
Phones Plus has been enhanced with even more data!&nbsp; Twenty-five million
records have been added to the Phones Plus database. The Phones Plus
search now delivers more than 75 million phone numbers not currently
found in Electronic Directory Assistance. <br>

<br>
<small>Information available through the Phones Plus feature may not be
used for marketing solicitation or similar purpose. Service contains
cell phone numbers. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 U.S.C sec
227) prohibits uses of automatic telephone dialing systems to make any
call to any cellular telephone service or any other service for which
the called party is charged for the call.</small><br>
<br>

<b>MORE ARREST LOGS IN OUR CRIMINAL RECORDS SEARCH!</b> <br>
