    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Pursuant to law passed in December 2013 (Section 203 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013), access to information contained in the Social Security Administration's Death Master File (DMF) is limited for a three year period beginning on the date of an individual's death.&nbsp; As of March 26, 2014, access is limited to authorized users and recipients who qualify for certification.
    <br><br>
    A certification process was issued by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) late Friday, March 21, 2014.&nbsp; NTIS's certification program for access to the DMF requires that companies, which are receiving DMF information have a permissible purpose under the new law and have processes in place to protect the data provided to them.
    <br><br>
    The permissible purposes for receipt of the restricted DMF data are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Legitimate fraud prevention interest, and;
      <li>Legitimate business purpose pursuant to a law, governmental rule, regulation, or fiduciary duty
    </ul>
    IRBsearch is working to minimize disruption of service to our customers.&nbsp; We will notify customers of requirements for access to the restricted components of the DMF shortly.
    <br><br>
    Please be aware that there will be an impact on the currency of the deceased data you receive until you qualify for access under the NTIS program.&nbsp; If you do not qualify, then the deceased-records data you receive will exclude any DMF data for individuals with a date of death after March 26, 2014.&nbsp; Those records will remain unavailable for a period of three years from the date of the individual's death, after which time they will be made available to you.
    <br><br>
    Currently, IRBsearch has 121 Million records in its deceased-records database.&nbsp; These records include the current DMF data, as well as state data, and other proprietary data sources.&nbsp; Over 27 million of these records do not come from the DMF.&nbsp; For those customer that do not meet  the requirements specific to the NTIS program, IRBsearch will continue to provide value as a result of our industry-leading compilation of deceased-records information from alternative sources.
    <br><br>
    IRBsearch will continue to update you as additional information becomes available.
