    Based on your customer feedback, additional enhancements are available in My Account:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Add/ Update/Copy User Screens:</b>&nbsp; The Title field was re-labeled to Position Title; a new optional Name Prefix field was added; required fields are now denoted with bold type; and a new message is shown when Company Administrators attempt to add a LoginID that already exists.
      <li><b>Activity tab:</b>&nbsp; A message was added to the screen that states "No activity was found," when there are no transactions found within the selected time period.
    </ul>
    If you have any questions about these changes, please contact our friendly Customer Care Team at 800.447.2112, Option 3 or email us at <a href="mailto:customercare@irbsearch.com"><u><b>customercare@irbsearch.com</b></u></a>.
