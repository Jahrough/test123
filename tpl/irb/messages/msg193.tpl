<big><b>Now Available<br>
InstantID&reg; and Business InstantID&reg; with FraudDefender</b></big><br>

<br>
<b>InstantID</b> quickly searches billions of public records, alerting
you to potential data mis-keys, which are often mistaken for fraudulent
data.&nbsp; It automatically offers you alternative addresses, telephone
numbers, and Social Security Numbers (SSNs).&nbsp; InstantID combines
verification, validation, and risk detection processes to instantly
authenticate consumer and business identities, spot potential fraud or
identity theft, and automatically flag discrepancies found in a
person&#8217;s given data.<br>
<br>
<b>Business InstantID</b> helps you make connections between businesses
and their authorized agents.&nbsp; This solution helps you guard against
identity theft perpetrated through fabricated business entities.<br>
<br>
<b>FraudDefender&reg;</b> provides a proprietary score that predicts
application fraud risk.&nbsp; This additional feature within InstantID and
Business InstantID identifies characteristics indicative of fraud that
may not be obvious in your verification and validation process. &nbsp;<br>

<br>
