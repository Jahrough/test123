    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Querying in the MVR Wildcard Search has just gotten even easier.&nbsp; A VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) field has been added.&nbsp; You can now search using a partial VIN by utilizing wildcard characters.&nbsp; An Asterisk (*) is used to designate any number of characters, and a Question Mark (?) is used to designate a placeholder for one single character when utilizing the wildcard character functionality.

    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Link ID is an advanced data linking and analysis technology that is the power behind your IRBsearch&reg; information solution.&nbsp; It connects the breadth and depth of thousands of data sources to bring you relevant, insightful information, so you can make timely and accurate decisions.
    <br><br>
    When you run a Person Search, an individual's unique Link ID number is returned in the results.&nbsp; When you search using only the Link ID number in a new Person Search, you will gain:
    <ul>
      <li>A more precise and current view of your subject.</li>
      <li>An extensive history.</li>
      <li>Fast, optimum results.</li>
    </ul>
    Link ID delivers unmatched speed, intelligence and information so you can identify, analyze and locate your desired subjects.

    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    IRBsearch&reg; is pleased to announce that we recently enhanced Accurint with a new user interface feature -- "hover-over" functionality.&nbsp; 'Hover-over' functionality has been added to the search tabs to provide you with a quick view of searches available in each category.&nbsp; The available searches in the 'hover-over' list will also be hyperlinked and clicking on a search link will load the corresponding search form.
    <br><br>
    We hope you enjoy these changes and as always, we appreciate you choosing IRBsearch&reg;.&nbsp; <b>If you have any questions regarding these new enhancements, please call 1-800-447-2112.</b>
