    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    Based on user feedback, we have enhanced the Marriage and Divorce search with optional spouse first and last name fields. By providing additional spousal information, users will be able to more easily refine results for search subjects with common names.
    <br><br>
    We hope you enjoy these changes and as always, we appreciate you choosing IRBsearch<sup>&reg;</sup>. <b>If you have any questions regarding these new enhancements, please call</b> 1-800-447-2112.
