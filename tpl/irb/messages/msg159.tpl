enhancements!<br>

<br>
<b>The PATRIOT Act search has been improved!</b><br>
<br>
A new search process (an adjustable fuzzy logic search) will provide:<br>
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Flexible name matching to reduce false positive hits <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Parts of names are weighted in order to provide more accurate name
matching <br>

&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consideration of a sanctioned country being an exclusionary factor
<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Results display with highest matching score(s) first thus
providing a quick assessment of false/positive results <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Customer controlled threshold levels which can be set per your
business requirements<br>
