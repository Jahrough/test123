Information Regarding Social Security Number Masking</STRONG></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Due to recent legislation regarding Social Security 
Number masking in the State of Minnesota (SF 2390), a policy has been 
implemented to further maintain the integrity and privacy of the Social Security 
Number in all US states. Effective June 26th, 2008, customers who are eligible 
to receive unmasked social security numbers, will no longer receive full 
unmasked social security numbers in their responses unless the customer has a 
permissible Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) purpose for the inquiry and selects 
(or if applicable preselects) that purpose.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>For customers that have a permissible 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) purpose for the inquiry and do select 
appropriately that purpose, there will be no change to social security number 
masking.</FONT></DIV>
