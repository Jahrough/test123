<font face="arial" size="2">
<br><br>
New functionality has recently been added to the Comprehensive Report that will allow you to utilize dynamic reporting capabilities and options to better enhance your report results.&nbsp; When displaying a Comprehensive Report, you can now expand and collapse sections from within this report by clicking the appropriate links ( + / - ), and all sections can be expanded or collapsed by clicking the <i>"Expand/Collapse All"</i> links, which are available below the subject information.
<br><br>
New printing functionality has also been added to the Comprehensive Report Section that will allow you to print certain sections by clicking the Print Icon that appears to the right of the header of each section.&nbsp; When you place your mouse over the section of interest or the Print Icon, the section of the report will also become highlighted so you can easily view what you have selected to print.
<br><br>
Please contact your account representative with any questions regarding this new addition to IRBsearch.
