    Due to a security vulnerability called "Poodle", as of December 7th, some users with outdated versions of certain web browsers may not be able to access the LexisNexis solutions.  The most commonly impacted software is Internet Explorer version 6.
    <br><br>
    To ensure that you maintain uninterrupted access to your LexisNexis solutions, we are encouraging all users to work with their network administrators or IT organizations to upgrade their Internet Explorer web browser software to the most current version.  Alternatively, current web browsers from other vendors, such as FireFox, Mozilla or Chrome can be used to access your LexisNexis Solutions.
    <br><br>
    As information, this vulnerability may permit the decryption by third parties of encrypted information transmitted between browsers and servers that use an obsolete cryptographic protocol (SSL version 3) to communicate, instead of the newer TLS protocol.  In order to further enhance the protection against this vulnerability, on December 7th, LexisNexis will disable Secure Socket Layer (SSL v.3), and require Transport Layer Service (TLS) for our products.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions about this system change, please contact LexisNexis Customer Support at <b>866.277.8407  or <a href="https://accurint.custhelp.com/" target="_blank"><u>Email Us</u></b></a>.
