    American Medical Information's Physician & Surgeons
    Database is compiled by over 300 full-time researchers. The information is initially
    collected from over 5,000 yellow page and business white pages directories, hundreds of
    trade publications, public records, and professional directories. Each entry is then phone
    verified by tele-researchers who add additional information, expanding the number of fields
    and the demographics capabilities for the file. For instance, physicians can be located by
    the average number of prescriptions they write each week or by their HMO affiliation.
