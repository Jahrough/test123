You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless D&B from any claim or cause of action against D&B arising out of or relating to use of the Information by individuals or entities which have not been authorized by this Agreement to have access to and/or use the Information.
    <br><br>
    3. You understand that you are the beneficiary of a contract between D&B and Seisint, Inc. ("SEISINT") and that, under that contract, both D&B and SEISINT have reserved certain rights which may result in the termination of your right to receive Information from D&B. In addition, D&B may terminate this Agreement at any time if you breach any of its terms.
    <br><br>
    4. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT D&B DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THE TIMELINESS, CURRENTNESS, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE INFORMATION. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EVERY BUSINESS DECISION INVOLVES THE ASSUMPTION OF A RISK AND THAT D&B, IN FURNISHING THE INFORMATION TO YOU, DOES NOT AND WILL NOT UNDERWRITE THAT RISK, IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER. YOU THEREFORE AGREE THAT D&B WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY D&B'S NEGLIGENCE IN PROCURING, COMPILING, COLLECTING, INTERPRETING, REPORTING, COMMUNICATING OR DELIVERING THE INFORMATION.

    5. YOU AGREE THAT D&B WILL NEVER BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT D&B'S LIABILITY OF ANY AND ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES WHICH YOU SUFFER OR INCUR ARISING OUT OF ANY ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF D&B IN CONNECTION WITH ANYTHING TO BE DONE OR FURNISHED HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY AND REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL RIGHT CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN VIOLATED, SHALL NEVER EXCEED $10,000.00 AND YOU COVENANT AND PROMISE THAT YOU WILL NOT SUE D&B FOR A GREATER AMOUNT.

You shall not commit or permit any act or omission by your agents, employees or any third party that would impair D&B's proprietary and intellectual property rights in the Information. You agree to notify D&B immediately upon obtaining any information regarding a threatened or actual infringement of D&B's rights.
    <br><br>
    7. These Terms of Agreement are in addition to those found in any SEISINT service agreement.
