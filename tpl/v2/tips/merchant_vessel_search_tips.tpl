        <p>Find a watercraft record using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ol id="font81">
		<li>Search by Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. You can also use a partial first name.<br /><br /></li>
		<li>Search by Address, City, and State. This returns records using that address. <br /><br /></li>
		<li>Search by Hull ID. This will return all records with that Hull ID.<br /><br /></li>
		<li>Search by Vessel Name. Information on all vessels with the same name will be returned.<br /><br /></li>
