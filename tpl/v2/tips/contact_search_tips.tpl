<h2>Contact Plus Search Tips</h2>

<p>
First, try to locate the subject using one or more of the following search techniques:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol id="font81">
  <li>
    If you know the subject's Social Security Number (SSN) use it alone in your first search. Even though SSNs are the most reliable identifier for an individual, they are not 100 percent dependable because some records may not contain a subject's SSN. Therefore, a record for an individual may not appear when searching using SSN only. Conducting a second search using Address and Zip provides additional coverage.<br /><br />
  </li><li>
    Search using Last Name, First Name, Street Address and Zip. If too many records are returned, try adding the City and State. Adding criteria not already used, such as first name, middle name, city, state, or zip code refines a search. The more criteria you provide the more precise (narrow) the results will be. Keep in mind that some records may not contain a middle name or initial, so providing one could eliminate records you may want included.<br /><br />
  </li><li>
    Search using a Telephone Number. You will want to use the 10 digit phone number.<br /><br />
  </li><li>
    Search using LexID. LexID uses our proprietary linking technology, which helps to narrow your search to one debtor, similar to searching with an SSN.<br /><br />
  </li><li>
    Search using an Email address. When searching by an email address, a properly formatted email address should be used.
  </li>
</ol>
