	<p><strong>The Basic Phone Lookup search verifies the information you enter and returns the best available results from the DAILY updated databases of the Regional Bell Operating Companies, Local Exchange Companies, and Competitive Local Exchange Companies.</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Find a telephone record using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>Search by Last Name (or Company Name) and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. If too few are returned, try adding the "Find Similar Sounding Names" option.<br /><br/>
	  Names are assumed to be abbreviated; no wild card character is required. If you are unsure of a name's spelling, enter only the beginning letters of which you are sure. If you want only exact matches to a name, add a period (.) at the end.<br/><br/>
	  </li>
	  <li>Search by Address, City, and State.<br/><br/>
	  If you are unsure of the exact city, supply the closest city and specify a radius (no more than 100 miles). This expands the area considered to a circle extending the specified number of miles from the center of that city. If you do not include a name, the radius option is not allowed. When conducting a radius search, you can exclude the specified city by checking the Exclude City checkbox. This is useful when searching for a subject who lives near a major city but not actually in that city.<br/><br/>
	  </li>
	  </ol>

	<p>You can limit searches to include only residences or only businesses, or both.</p>
