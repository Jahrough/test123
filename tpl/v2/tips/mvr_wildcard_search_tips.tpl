	<h2>MVR Wildcard Search Tips</h2>
        <p><b>The MVR Wildcard Search accesses motor vehicle data to run matches on partial license plate tags as well as car makes, models, and colors.</b></p>
	<p>&nbsp;<br>Find vehicle registration information using several search techniques -- including the following:<br>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol id="font81">
          <li>Search by partial Tag Number.&nbsp; Use the asterisk (*) to search for any characters preceding or following the asterisk symbol (example *A123 or ABC 1*).&nbsp; Use a question mark ("?") to designate a placeholder for one single character in any position within the tag number field (example AB?123).<br><br></li>
	  <li>Search using the "Tag Contains" box to query for any combination of information in the Tag Number field.&nbsp; This works well when you have the numbers and letters for a tag, but aren't sure of the exact order.&nbsp; Wildcard characters cannot be used with this option.<br><br></li>
          <li>Search using Make and Model to narrow down potential matches when entering wildcard/partial tag information.&nbsp; If more than one vehicle Make is entered, only one model can be selected.&nbsp; If only one Make is entered, one or more Models can be selected.<br><br></li>
          <li>Search by Zip to narrow down potential matches when entering wildcard/partial tag information.&nbsp; When you select ENTER or click on the Zip Code field, a window will open allowing you to enter from one to twenty zip codes as part of your search criteria.<br><br></li>
          <li>Refining a Name Search.&nbsp; If the last name of the registered owner of the vehicle is known, it may be used to help refine your search.&nbsp; Try further refining your search by adding first name, middle name, or middle initial.&nbsp; Keep in mind that some records may not contain a middle name or initial, so providing one could eliminate records you may want included.<br><br></li>
        </ol>
