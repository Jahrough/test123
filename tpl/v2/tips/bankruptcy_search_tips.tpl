	<p><strong>The Bankruptcy search provides access to a listing of personal and business bankruptcy filings from 50 states, District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. All US Bankruptcy District Courts are contained in this listing. Date coverage may vary depending on the District Court. Information is updated Daily; Monday through Friday, except holidays.</strong></p>

        <p>Locate the subject's bankruptcy records using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>If you know the subject's Social Security Number (SSN) or a company's Federal Tax ID Number (FEIN) use it alone in your first search.   Even though SSNs are the most reliable identifier for an individual, they are not 100 percent dependable because some records may not contain a subject's SSN. Therefore, a record for an individual may not appear when searching using SSN only. Conducting a second search using Name and State provides additional coverage.<br />
          <br /></li>
	  <li>Search using Last Name, First Name, and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. You can also use a partial first name.<br/>
	  <br /></li>
	  </ol>
