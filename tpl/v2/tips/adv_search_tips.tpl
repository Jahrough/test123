	<p>Try to find your subject using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>Search using your subject's name and the first name of a relative. For example, if you are looking for John Doe and you know he has a relative with the first name of Jane.<br />
	  <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using your subject's name and include a name they may have previously used or may be currently using. For example, Jane Doe may have previously been known as Jane Smith.<br />
	    <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using your subject's name and state of residence as well as any previous state or states (maximum of two) in which they may have resided. For example, Jane Doe in Florida and previously resided in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<TMPL_IF NAME="SHOW_FULL_ADDR_HISTORY">  The results are targeted to those states you entered. You can check the "Include Full Address History" for full address results.</TMPL_IF><br />
	    <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using your subject's name, city and state and include the name of another city and state in which they may have lived. For example, Jane Doe in Sunrise, Florida, and Tallahassee, Florida.<br />
	    <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using your subject's name and the last four digits of their Social Security Number. For example, Jane Doe and 1234. You may even use a partial first name.<br />
	    <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using your subject's last name and first and middle initials. For example, J.D. Doe.<br />
	    <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using your subject's name and partial street address. For example, Jane Doe on Main Street, Anywhere, FL.<br />
	    <br />
	  </li>

	  </ol>
