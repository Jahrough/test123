	<h2>Comprehensive Person Search Tips</h2>
	<p><strong>The Comprehensive Person Search can be used to perform a deeper search to locate your debtor by incorporating multiple datasets within one search.</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In order to conduct this search, our product must be able to uniquely identify the debtor being searched. For optimal results, a search should be conducted using an SSN.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Find more debtor information by using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>Search by SSN. If too many records are returned, try adding the debtor's last name and first name.<br />
	  <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using debtors last name, first name, street address, city, state, and zip code.<br />
	    <br />
	  </li>

	  </ol>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Some records may have supplemental information which can be obtained by clicking on the report icons provided on the results page. </p>
