	<h2><TMPL_IF XBPS>Corporate Records<TMPL_ELSE>Corporation</TMPL_IF> Search Tips</h2>
	<p><strong>The <TMPL_IF XBPS>Corporate Records<TMPL_ELSE>Corporation</TMPL_IF> search accesses information on records of corporation and limited partnerships from 49 states plus the District of Columbia.</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Find a corporate record using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>Search by Company Name and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City.<br />
          <br /></li>
	  <li>If you know an Officer of a Corporation or if an individual is the subject of your research, search using Last Name, First Name, and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City. You can also use a partial first name.<br/>
	  <br /></li>
	  <li>Search by Address, City, and State. Keep in mind that some corporate records use the Registered Agent's address so it may not be 100% reliable.<br/>
	  <br /></li>
	  </ol>
