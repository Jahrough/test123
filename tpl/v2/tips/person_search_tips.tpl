	<p><strong><TMPL_IF FCOL>Find a Person<TMPL_ELSE>Person</TMPL_IF> Searches are targeted so you can find the most you can about an individual, from skip tracing them, to building a detailed profile. "Find a Person" allows you to start your session quickly, as broadly or as narrowly as you like.</strong></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>First, try to locate the subject using one or more of the following search techniques:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol id="font81">
	  <li>If you know the subject's Social Security Number (SSN) use it alone in your first search. Even though SSNs are the most reliable identifier for an individual, they are not 100 percent dependable because some records may not contain a subject's SSN. Therefore, a record for an individual may not appear when searching using SSN only. Conducting a second search using Name and State provides additional coverage.<br />

	    <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using Last Name, First Name, and State. If too many records are returned, try adding a City or State. You can also use a partial first name. Adding criteria not already used, such as first name, middle name or initial, DOB, city, state, ZIP code, or age range, refines a search. The more criteria you provide the more precise (narrow) the results will be.<br />
	    <br />
	    Keep in mind that some records may not contain a middle name or initial, so providing one could eliminate records you may want included.<br />
	    <br />
	    If you are unsure of the subject's proper first name, try using a variation of the name. Our intuitive automatic nickname feature will return results matching the subject's proper first name.<br />

	    <br />
	    If you are unsure of the spelling of a person's name, try checking the Phonetic Search box which will search for phonetic variations of the subject's name if no exact match is found.<br />
	    <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using a Telephone Number. You may use seven digits, with or without a State.<br />
	    <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using a Last Name, First Name, State, and full or partial Date of Birth (DOB). A DOB may be entered in several formats: mm/yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy, or yyyy alone.<br />

      For Example: 1). Month and Year: (04/1963) 2). Month, Day and Year: (04/23/1963) 3). Year Only: (1963)<br />
      In the event that a Subject's complete DOB is unknown, searching by mm/yyyy or yyyy format may prove helpful.<br />
	  <br />
	  </li>
	  <li>Search using a DOB and First Name. If more records are returned than are practical to review, refine your search by adding a City and State or Zip Code.</li>
	  </ol>
