Credentials</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>Ultimately, you are responsible for securing
data and the applications you access on the computer you use. The use of strong
passwords acts as a deterrent against password guessing. The security of each
individual user is closely related to the security of the whole system. Creating
effective passwords can provide additional means of protecting the information
on your computer.</FONT></DIV><FONT size=2 face=Arial>

  <LI>Never use any easy-to-guess phrases, such as &#8220;LetMeIn&#8221; or &#8220;MyPassword&#8221; as
  your password.</LI>
  <LI>Avoid using your birth date, your child&#8217;s name, your pet&#8217;s name, and your
  spouse&#8217;s name.</LI>
  <LI>Don&#8217;t select a password that a hacker could guess simply by looking around
  your cubicle or office.</LI>
  <LI>Dictionary-proof it: Hackers run &#8220;dictionary hacks&#8221; in which they check
  passwords against every word in the dictionary.&nbsp; Defeat this attack by
  using a number or a special character in your password.</LI>
  <LI>Be sure to memorize it and never write it down. One trick to remembering
  your strong password is to create a phrase that sticks in your head but is
  virtually impossible to guess.</LI>
  <LI>Change your password often especially if you feel someone has seen you
  type your password or you have mistakenly given it to someone.</LI>
  <LI>Never give out a password over the phone or send it via email.</LI></UL>
