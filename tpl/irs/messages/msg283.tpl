    <font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br><br>
    LexisNexis&reg; is pleased to announce that we recently enhanced Accurint with a new user interface feature -- "hover-over" functionality.&nbsp; 'Hover-over' functionality has been added to the search tabs to provide you with a quick view of searches available in each category.&nbsp; The available searches in the 'hover-over' list will also be hyperlinked and clicking on a search link will load the corresponding search form.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions regarding these new enhancements, please contact your LexisNexis Account Representative or call Customer Support at 1-866-277-8407.
