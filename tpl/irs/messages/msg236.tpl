<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>New functionality has recently been added to the 
report ordering screen that will allow users to request a Business Comprehensive 
Report and an Experian Business Report without having to conduct multiple 
searches.&nbsp; After conducting a Business Search a report icon will appear to 
the left of each result to allow users to order a report on that specific 
business.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>After requesting a report, users will be prompted 
with the report ordering window which will allow them to select features and 
options of data sources to be searched and displayed in the Business 
Comprehensive Report.&nbsp; The Business Comprehensive Report will include, when 
available, business-related information from Secretaries of State, Federal 
Employment Identification numbers, asset information such as vehicles and 
property, UCC filings, phone listing, and information on executives and persons 
related to the business. Additionally, users will now have the capability of 
running an Experian Business Report by checking off the corresponding box. When 
this option is selected the Business Comprehensive Report will be returned as 
well as an Experian Business Report within one output document that can be 
printed or saved.</FONT></DIV>
