	  LexisNexis&reg; is proud to introduce an email address-based social networking site search. <br>
	  <br>
	  Clients supply the subject's email address or LexisNexis&reg; generates the email address after the user conducts an email address search.  The resulting information is then provided to a leading content partner to generate the <strong>Social Network Report</strong>. This report provides the end user with a list of all matching social network public-facing pages (URLs) for the search subject in cases where a match to the sites' registered email address is found. Over 35 social networking sites are checked for a match against the email address(es) submitted for the search subject.
	  </p>
	  <p class="style1">
	  <strong>Why use this report?</strong><br>
	  Clients may wish to use this report to get a better sense of where the subject is physically located and obtain other information (interests, subject-provided content) that would aid in making contact 

 
      or validating the existence of an identity. Matching page results are typically limited to public-facing pages, but often enough useful additional information is provided in these pages that can get the user closer to the subject.	  </p>	  
	  <p class="style1">
	By providing additional information relevant to the search subject (anything from associates to interests/activities/location information to timing (date relocated, date last logged in, other subject-provided dates), this search yields additional leads and tips that can help product users track down their subjects or validate the existence of an identity.
