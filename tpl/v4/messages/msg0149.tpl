	  <p class="style1">The <strong>Person Alerts</strong> functionality will automatically notify you of changes to individual subjects or persons of interests without you having to repeatedly run the same search. </p>

If Person Alerts has been enabled for your account, you can take advantage of this valuable new functionality by clicking on <strong>Find a Person and SmartLinx&reg; Person Report</strong>, running a search and clicking "Set up Alert" under the "Actions" column.  A pop-up screen will appear allowing you to set up your alerts and allow you to stay informed about changes to individual subjects or persons of interest.</p>
     
	  <p class="style7">Sex Offender Alerts &#x96; Now Available</p>
	  <p class="style1">The <strong>Sex Offenders Alerts</strong> functionality will automatically notify you of any changes to sex offenders' locations and/or movements into regions of interest.</p>	  
      <p class="style1">Take advantage of this new functionality to monitor a geographic region and receive notification when a sex offender has moved in, out, or within that area. Alert notifications are displayed within the LexisNexis Investigative Portal application, and if desired, are also sent by email. A pop-up screen will appear allowing you to set up your alerts and allow you to stay informed about changes to persons of interest.</p>
