	   <br>LexisNexis Virtual Identity Search and Report* provides government and law enforcement agencies with an alternate view of an entity, their virtual presence. </p>
       <p class="style4">With this enhanced search functionality, you can determine if a virtual identity or web footprint exists for your person of interest within seconds, without having to access multiple sites &#x96; saving you and your agency significant time and effort. </p>
       <p class="style4">Investigators and researchers can now run a subject's email address within the Investigative Portal and determine if that email address is linked to any social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn). Additionally, when you request a Virtual Identity Report in the Investigative Portal, you will receive a list of all matching social network and/or virtual identity public-facing pages (URLs) when a match is found between the search subject's email and a site's ‘registered' email address. </p>       <p class="style4"><strong>Capture a More Complete View with Social Networking Information and Experience these Benefits Today:</strong></p>       <ul style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">
