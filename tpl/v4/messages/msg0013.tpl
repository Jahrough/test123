       <p class="style1"><strong>Complimentary InstantID&reg; Enhancements ...</strong></p>
       <p class="style25"> LexisNexis&reg; Risk Solutions Group is committed to continually improving our solutions and coming soon, you'll see exciting enhancements to InstantID&reg;. <br>
         <br>
      In an effort to provide you with the highest quality, most up-to-date information possible, we're implementing the following <strong>complimentary enhancements to help make your job easier: </strong></p>
      <ul class="style25">
       <li class="style_listbullets"><strong>Optional P.O. (Post Office) Box Compliance: </strong>We've listened to customers who require opening accounts with a physical address. As a result, we have modified InstantID&reg; to add a "P.O. Box Compliance" option for Administrators. If selected, a P.O. Box entered on input will impact the InstantID score. A new warning code and a new follow-up action code will be returned. If your Administrator sets the "P.O. Box Compliance" option to "false" or does not indicate a preference, the warning code will be returned, but there will be no action code returned and the score will not be affected.</li>
      <br>
      <li class="style_listbullets"><strong>Optional OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) DOB (Date of Birth) Range: </strong>Activating this option on the InstantID search form will allow customers to reduce false positives on the OFAC list by including a year of birth range in the input. For example, if the input date of birth is within +/- 3 years of the date of birth on the OFAC file, it will be considered a hit; otherwise it will be considered a miss. </li>
      <br>
      <li class="style_listbullets"><strong>Date ranges returned in searches: </strong> Date ranges will be included on the three alternate addresses returned in the InstantID report, helping to further detail your research.</li>
      <br>
      <li class="style_listbullets"><strong>5 digit zip code + 4 verified zip code returned: </strong> InstantID will return a 9-digit (5 digit zip + 4) verified zip code, helping to provide more precise location information.</li>
      <br>
      <li class="style_listbullets"><strong>New Risk Codes Added </strong></li>
           <ul class="style21">
             <li class="style_listbullets2"><strong>New "Multiple identities associated with input social" risk code added: </strong> If there are multiple identities found for one SSN, there will be a reason code stating " <strong>Multiple identities associated with input social. </strong>"&nbsp; The additional risk code allows you to determine whether further due diligence is required. 
      	   <br>
             <li class="style_listbullets2"><strong>Added logic to address mismatch risk code to better identify potential secondary address mismatches, (e.g., units, apt. #'s, etc.) </strong>We have added additional logic to the existing address mismatch reason code in InstantID. We are also adding a new reason code of " <strong>Address mismatch on secondary address range </strong>" to identify mismatched secondary address ranges. As a result, these enhancements will also help customers comply with the Identity Theft Red Flags Rule.
      	   <br>
             <li class="style_listbullets2"><strong>New "Input SSN is an ITIN Individual Tax Identification Number" risk code added: </strong> When an Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) is entered instead of a Social Security Number (SSN), a new reason code of " <strong>Input SSN is an ITIN </strong> (Individual Tax Identification Number)" and a new action code of "<strong>ITINs are not to be used for ID purposes. Please consult your organization's policy</strong>" will be returned. 
      	   <br>
             <li class="style_listbullets2"><strong>Additional Risk Code Added: </strong> We are adding an additional risk code indicating a " <strong>Potential address discrepancy - the input address may be a previous address."&nbsp; </strong>Presence of this new warning code does not reduce the score; rather it provides you with additional information regarding the applicant's input address. </li>
           </ul>
         </li>
       </ul><br>
       <p class="style25">If you have any questions, please feel free to contact your account manager or call <strong>1-866-277-8407 </strong>.
