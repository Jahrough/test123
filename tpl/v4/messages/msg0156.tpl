	  <span><strong>Bankruptcy search added to Find a Person</strong></span> <br>
	  AML Insight&trade; and Risk Management Page subscribers now have the option of adding a bankruptcy search to their Find a Person search inquiry. The new feature streamlines the search process while delivering more robust Find a Person results.
	  </p>
	  <p class="style1">
	  <span><strong>Benefit to our clients</strong></span><br>
	  The new search option leverages the matching/linking power of LinkID via the Find A Person search to locate Bankruptcy filings for individuals.  This enhancement is useful for anyone searching for bankruptcy filings having limited information on a subject or searching for individuals whose name and/or address has changed.   The combined search is also convenient and improves productivity for customers.</p>
	  <p class="style1">
	  Selecting the option to run the bankruptcy search from the Find A Person search will incur a charge equal to Find A Person plus the contracted cost of a Bankruptcy search, just as if the two searches were run separately.  </p>
	  <ul class="style6" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">
           <li> Find A Person search is $0.50* <br />
