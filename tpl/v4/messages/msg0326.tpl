   <p>LexisNexis has received notification from the IRS of a mandatory customer re-verification policy.  Starting July 15, 2016, the IRS will suspend delivery of transcripts requested through the IRS Verify product until all customers have been re-verified and have certified adherence to the IRSâ€™s new policies. You may continue to submit orders, but please be aware that the IRS will not fulfill them until we obtain specific information from your company's authorized signatory.</p>
   <p>LexisNexis will be contacting you very soon to collect the required information. Please be assured we are working as quickly as possible to minimize delays. We apologize for this sudden, unavoidable inconvenience and we appreciate your patience and understanding.</p>
