In order to add a new announcement either:

1. Create a new msgNNNN.tpl file by hand, making sure to fill in the "<input type=hidden..." parameter information correctly

                                 OR

2. Run ./new_msg.sh , filling out all of the prompted information. This will create a new announcement file in a basic announcment template format. You can then edit the announcement, adding your announcement body message.


3. Edit the file manually, adding message content in whatever style is desired. Update any/all information between the following lines:

<!-- EDIT FROM HERE DOWN -->


...


<!-- EDIT FROM HERE UP -->



4. Update the cfg files (e.g. bps-dev.cfg, bps-prod.cfg, ...) setting the V4_CURRENT_MESSAGE to the value of the new message.
