        <p class="style1">Product Enhancement: InstantID&reg; and InstantID&reg; for Business </p>
        <p class="style2"> In an effort to provide you with the highest quality, most up-to-date information possible, we're implementing the following <strong>enhancements effective late February, 2009 to help make your job easier:<br>
        </strong></p>
        <ul>
         <li class="style_listbullets"> <strong>New "Multiple SSNs Reported With Applicant" risk code added to Batch, XML and Online output.</strong> Through our matching/linking technology, we have the capability to identify instances where one individual is associated with multiple Social Security Numbers (3 or more) across multiple public record sources. Adding this logic to InstantID&reg; and the authorized representative portion of InstantID&reg; for Business helps institutions identify potential high risk individuals and comply with the Red Flags Rule regulation.<br>
         </li>
        <br>
        <li class="style_listbullets"> <strong>Name/Address/Phone and Name/Address/Social Security Number verification summary will be included to InstantID&reg; online.</strong> A summary indicating the level of the match of the submitted Name, Address, Phone (NAP) and submitted Name, Address, and SSN (NAS) will be added to the online interface to provide more granular detail in addition to the Comprehensive Verification Index (CVI). The NAP and NAS indices are already included in Batch and XML outputs.<br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="style_listbullets"> <strong>Business Name/Address/Phone (BNAP), Business Name/Address/Social Security Number (BNAS) and Business Name/Address/Tax Identification Number (BNAT) verification summaries will be included online in InstantID&reg; for Business. </strong>To provide more detail in addition to the Business Verification Index (BVI). The BNAP, BNAS and BNAT are already part of the output structure for Batch and XML.
          <br>
          <br>
        <li class="style_listbullets"> <strong>Optional OFAC name matching tolerance setting will be added to XML delivery of InstantID&reg; and InstantID&reg; for Business*. </strong>Including this option in the XML input for InstantID&reg; and InstantID&reg; for Business will allow customers to reduce false positives on the OFAC list by setting a tolerance percentage to narrow the name matching threshold.
          <br>
          <br>
        <li class="style_listbullets"> <strong>Full name field will be added to the XML input structure for InstantID&reg; for Business*.</strong> Providing an additional option to input a name rather than separating into first name and last name fields.
          <br>
          <br>
        <li class="style_listbullets"> <strong>County name will be added to the output for InstantID&reg; and InstantID&reg; for Business in Batch*, XML* and Online delivery channels. </strong>The county name will be returned in the output for the consumer address, the business address and the authorized representative address.
          <br>
          <br>
        <li class="style_listbullets"> <strong>Improved matching and linking added to InstantID&reg; for Business.</strong> LexisNexis is making improvements to business matching and linking the authorized representative to the company.
          <br>
          <br>
        <li class="style_listbullets"> <strong>Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and descriptions added to InstantID&reg; for Business in Batch*, XML* and Online. </strong>Use this feature to help determine the nature of the business you are inquiring about. The SIC Code will be added if code is available.
          <br>
          <br>
        <li class="style_listbullets"> 
        <strong>Middle name field added to InstantID&reg; and the authorized rep section of InstantID&reg; for Business online.</strong> The middle name field will be added online to help pinpoint the individual you wish to verify.
        </ul><br>
        <blockquote>
          <span class="style7">*These enhancements require an upgrade to the latest version of&nbsp; InstantID or Business InstantID in XML and Batch </span><br>
        </blockquote>
