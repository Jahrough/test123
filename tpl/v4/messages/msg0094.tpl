Based on the source information, you will also be in a better position to direct your investigations by making more informed decisions.</span><br>
                <br>
                Upon receiving the results from each Person Search, you will have the option to view which specific sources were used to compile the search results, how many instances of a particular source were used to generate the result, and when the specific data first and last appeared within the source.  Additionally, there is a print icon on the source documents window where you will be able to print your results.  <br>
