    <h2>Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) Permissible Use Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
        Below is a more detailed description of the DPPA permissible uses. Each description
        is followed by a list of states that recognize the permissible use. By selecting a
        permissible use, your search will be run against the drivers' licenses, motor vehicle
        registrations and boat registrations for the states that recognize the permissible use
        you selected. If you select I Do Not Have a Permissible Use, your search results will
        not include drivers' licenses, motor vehicle registrations and boat registrations.
